It has been 5 years since I tasted Ecuadorian chocolates. 
One of these little coincidences in my life, probably the most beautiful of all, is the one that made me meet an Ecuadorian woman in Switzerland, the country of chocolate if there is one... in Europe.
The consequences of this meeting are multiple, and all beautiful (she is now my wife!). But the most delicious one is the one that brings me, at least once a year at Christmas time, to Quito, the Ecuadorian capital, a magical city located on the side of a volcano, at an altitude of almost 3000 m.

Ecuador is the 7th largest cocoa producing country in the world. But what makes it special is that it is the main producer of arriba cocoa, also called nacional, which has a fine and floral taste. This rare species is considered a national treasure: in recent years, the fine chocolate industry has been booming in Ecuador.

Once a year, I have the opportunity to renew my supply of Ecuadorian chocolate, with arriba cocoa if you please, and to enjoy its diversity. Because yes, each region of this magnificent and so varied country has its sun, its humidity, and its traditions. Like wine or oysters, the growing conditions of cocoa influence its flavor. Likewise, the differences in its transformation into chocolate give very different results. Finally, it is common to add local flavors to chocolate, such as fruits or herbs. This opens up a wide range of possibilities!

This site is intended to be a guide, and a journal, for exploring the magnificent variety of Ecuadorian chocolates.

For each bar, you will find a description as well as a graded evaluation. I also try to describe the history and background of each brand. As I taste new bars, they will be added to this guide!
