This is not meant to be a flavored chocolate per se. However, the ingredients list includes some machica (toasted barley flour) and cedrón (verbena).

The product is gentle and rich, evoking vanilla chestnut cream both in taste and texture. The toasted barley brings cereal notes, while the verbena adds a subtle fresh lift.

It's a pleasant, fine, and original chocolate in Huma's tradition of excellence.

P.S. The tablet packaging, with Tigua mask artwork, deserves a mention on its own!
