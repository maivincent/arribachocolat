A little treat. It's a chocolate that disappears quickly - probably because it's sweeter! Republica del Cacao's milk chocolate is as fine as the dark chocolate. You get the richness of the arriba cocoa while enjoying the slightly more indulgent and less bitter side. The pieces of "Inca berry" (a cousin of the Quebec ground cherry) provide welcome bursts of acidity!
A great value for those with a sweet tooth!
