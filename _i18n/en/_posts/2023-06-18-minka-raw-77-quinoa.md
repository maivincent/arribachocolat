Like other Minka Raw 77% bars, this is a somewhat bitter chocolate evoking coffee and pepper.
The small quinoa bits, under the bar, bring a bit of body and roundness. They still melt on the tongue and quickly blend into the chocolate.

A standard, no-frills chocolate that does its job without dazzling.
