The hierbaluisa is an aromatic plant of South America, also called verbena of Peru whose taste resembles very much the citronella. In this chocolate, the taste of cocoa rather intense at the beginning quickly settles in the background. It then complements the tangy and lemony taste of the aromatic herb. The interactions between the two flavors make for complexity, to the detriment of the cocoa taste.
I have a mixed relationship with hierbaluisa. On the one hand, it reminds me of the citronella candles we used when I was a kid to chase away mosquitoes. Not the best memory. On the other hand, it takes me back to Vilcabamba, Ecuador, when to warm up in front of the sunset, we drank a tea with hierbaluisa directly from the garden, with a little sugar; the drink was delicious, and the moment unforgettable.

This chocolate is for those who love the taste of this particular aromatic herb, which blends with cocoa in a complex, balanced and refreshing relationship.
