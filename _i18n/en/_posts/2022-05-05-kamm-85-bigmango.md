Despite the presence of mango and sweeteners, this is not a very sweet chocolate. The mango here has no acidity: it completes the depth of a dark and sober chocolate, without bitterness but without sparkle.

In Kamm's world, this chocolate is supposed to give us energy. Yet the sugar is replaced by sweetener. It's a bit paradoxical, energy without calories... (ok, maybe I'm being petty here!) Nevertheless, it's an interesting chocolate, but it lacks the indulgence of a little guilty pleasure.
