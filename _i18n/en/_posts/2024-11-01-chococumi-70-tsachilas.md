ChocoCumi's "Lugares de mi tierra" bars are often excellent from the first square. This one, however, requires time to appreciate and explore its flavors.

On the first square it may seem empty, even slightly plastic. You sense the brand's signature notes but without much depth. On the second square, letting it melt, very gentle notes appear: melon, vanilla, blueberries... They define themselves more as you continue tasting the bar.

It's not a stunning chocolate and doesn't make the best first impression. But if you give it a chance, you can discover unique elements to appreciate.
