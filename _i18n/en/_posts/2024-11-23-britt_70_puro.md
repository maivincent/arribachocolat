Britt is a Costa Rican company, but this bar is produced in Ecuador.

It's a well-controlled chocolate with hazelnut and caramel notes reminiscent of praline ice cream. The smooth texture complements the comforting flavor, with not a hint of bitterness.

A pleasant chocolate, though not strikingly original.
