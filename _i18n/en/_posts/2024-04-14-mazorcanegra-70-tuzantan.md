Another Mexican chocolate, found at Mango y Chile in Bacalar. This bar uses cacao from Tuzantán in Chiapas. The bar is made from criollo (lizard-tail variety according to the box).

It's an intense chocolate with quick acidic notes of cranberry and cherry, followed by a citrusy bitterness that accompanies the fruity notes. The texture is smooth and melting — well handled.

Honestly, a very good chocolate. Its taste differs from Ecuadorian cacao but is original and fine.
