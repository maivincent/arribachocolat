**Warning: I know that the texture of this chocolate has been a little distorted, due to the whitening phenomenon. So in this article, I'm trying to get past that, while I wait to buy another bar for a more complete review**.

I find it hard to evaluate this chocolate. At first bite, it's not a "wow", or an "interesting", or an "original". It's hard to praise. Nor is it a "yuck", or a "yuck", or a "it's good but like Milka". It has its own color, and it's pleasant.

It's a rather herbaceous taste, which, if you close your eyes, makes you think of a walk in the Amazon, with the damp smell of leaves and the freshness of a waterfall. There's a hint of caramel, very little bitterness. Little evolution, too: the flavor is constant. Not very powerful, but easy to find. 

A good chocolate. Nothing extraordinary, other than being itself.
