The British speak of a cloud of milk in their tea - and the expression is spot on. With arriba cocoa, I often find that the milk hides the nuances and appeal like a cloud hides a starry sky.

But in some sunsets, the clouds are part of the show. Such is the case here. The fruity notes - mango, banana, passion fruit - of this chocolate are enhanced by its milky side.

Even so, there's a clear loss of depth compared with dark chocolates of the same brand. I think this is inevitable.
