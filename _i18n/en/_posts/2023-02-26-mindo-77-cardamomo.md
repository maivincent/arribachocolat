The Mindo 77% plain chocolate is a concentrate of roundness, honey and almond notes.
Adding cardamom seems obvious: Mindo offers a small journey towards Indian and Middle Eastern desserts.

The spice, delicate yet powerful, illuminates this excellent chocolate from a new angle while remaining spectacular.
