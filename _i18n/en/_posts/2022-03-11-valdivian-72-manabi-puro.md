The word that comes to mind to describe this chocolate is: comforting. It reminds me of a melting brownie, a delicious chocolate fondue, a dark CÃ´te d'Or patissier. Tasty and evident from the very first seconds, it offers above all notes of cinnamon and caramel, which however do not stay long in the mouth. 

A pleasant chocolate, of very good quality, that lacks however a little finesse and originality.
