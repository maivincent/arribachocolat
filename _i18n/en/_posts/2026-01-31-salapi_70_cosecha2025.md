On the box, Salapi specifies the origin of the 2025 harvest: 56% from Los Rios, 44% from the Galapagos.

This chocolate is gentle and fruity. You can pick out notes of caramel, dried apricot, and melon, with a smooth, controlled texture that melts calmly in the mouth.

A fine and pleasant experience.
