I had written a sharp critique of this bar. I indulged myself, exaggerating the criticism, because I don't often have occasion to be dramatic about Ecuadorian chocolate. Jicama is a slightly sweet tuber also called yam-bean, and I found it gives the bar an unpleasant turn reminiscent of turnip.

However, on learning more I discovered this is a specific product developed by a small family business producing jicama. They attempt to diversify their offering by proposing jicama as an alternative to sugar in chocolate. This Sapifit chocolate is unique in that sense. More importantly, it is the result of an entrepreneurial initiative whose spirit and challenge I must respect.

So I'll simply say I didn't finish the bar, and aside from its clear uniqueness I cannot recommend it.
