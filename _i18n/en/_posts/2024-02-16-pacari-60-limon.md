It's subtle, but it's present beneath Pacari's classic cacao. A slight note of lemon zest lifts this chocolate. Rather than the acidity of a lemon tart, it's the citrusy side — like candied lemon — that comes through with a touch of bitterness. It complements the cacao's roundness well.

This is not, however, my favorite Pacari.
