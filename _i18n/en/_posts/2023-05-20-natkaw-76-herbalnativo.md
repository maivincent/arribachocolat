Nat Kaw blends cocoa beans to create distinctive flavors. In this "herbal" chocolate, the objective is achieved. Flavors of tea, thyme, cumin and mint orbit a heart reminiscent of caramel.

It's an extraordinary chocolate for the exploration and diversity of its flavors. However, for my taste, its austere side makes it a bit out of comparison with its "frutal" counterpart from the same brand.
