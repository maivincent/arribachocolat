Of high quality, this fragrant chocolate fills the mouth with a thousand sensations. Herencia's rich cocoa — woody, fruity, and influenced by cane sugar — combines with the round, salty crunch of dried bananas.

Herencia Esmeraldas chocolates are a bit more expensive than others, but of very good quality.
