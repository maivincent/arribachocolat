This is a magnificent chocolate. The paste itself is rich with a thousand notes, floral, fruity, buttery, delicate and powerful. The marriage with the macadam praline is superb: when a piece of nut is added to the mix, it is a candy within a candy, an extra pleasure in an already delicious moment.
Truly, extraordinary.
Please note, however, that since this is a chocolate with nothing but cocoa, sugar and nuts, it is recommended to enjoy it soon after purchase... that shouldn't be a problem!
