Adding chunks to a bar, to give it a little crunch, has become a classic among Ecuadorian producers.
Mashpi also follows this suggestion. 
As usual with Mashpi's dazzling base, this chocolate is excellent. The cocoa nibs integrated into the bar give it the expected crunchiness.

However, I have to lower my score for uniqueness, because in this case, it's not the most original of the Mashpi series.
