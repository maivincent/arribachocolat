Another 100% chocolate that defies stereotypes. Conexion demonstrates here a fine and light cocoa. After a brief intense kick of black pepper and whiskey, the melting chocolate releases gentle notes of violet and licorice.

Perfectly balanced in terms of texture and astringency, it's a 100% chocolate that stands well on its own. A masterstroke by Conexion.
