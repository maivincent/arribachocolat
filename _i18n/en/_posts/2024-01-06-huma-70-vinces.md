From the very first bite, the verdict is clear: this is an excellent chocolate. Focused on hazelnut and dulce de leche, it melts delicately and with great roundness. A slightly woody note recalls certain Mindo chocolates.

This is the first Huma bar I've tried, and it's a pleasant surprise. I'm looking forward to the next ones!
