Friends brought me this chocolate from Mexico — always a welcome gift! According to the website, this is a trinitario cacao.

The flavor is pronounced with cherry and raisin notes, a grapefruit-like bitterness and a woody side. Despite the smooth, melting texture, there is little roundness: this chocolate goes straight to the point. After swallowing, a sensation of heat remains in the mouth as if of strong chili, though none is listed.

It makes for a fine and unique bar that impresses by its intensity.
