Lua is a discovery for me this year, although this bar won awards in 2019 and 2020. The cocoa comes from Chone in the Manabí region.

It's a gentle chocolate; you must give it time to express itself to appreciate its floral offering, with jasmine notes, and its fruity side with a curious echo of apricot jam.

Fine, unique and pleasant, it leaves an impression of delicacy and lightness.
