It's finally here! A Kallari chocolate in good condition, that lives up to its name.
Because, as you may know, the previous Kallari chocolate bars I tried had arrived in poor condition.

Here we taste the full roundness of Sacha cocoa, a unique species from Amazonia. As usual, a strong buttery taste and a strange freshness.
The little bits of salt are a very pleasant addition, bringing out certain nuances, in particular the woody, tangy side of the crunchy cocoa pieces.

A very good chocolate - which, in the context of this blog, puts Kallari in the big league.
