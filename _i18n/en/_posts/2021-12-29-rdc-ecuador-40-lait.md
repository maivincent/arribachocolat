I have always loved milk chocolate. As a child, and even as an adult before I knew about cocoa arriba, I did not like dark chocolate. But for the last few years, I've had more trouble: I can't find the subtlety of the cocoa in it, which seems to be hidden by the sweetness of the milk.
This chocolate from Republica del Cacao is a very good milk chocolate: soft, smooth and comforting. But it does not particularly stand out from other good milk chocolates.
