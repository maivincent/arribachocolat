When traveling in a tropical country, one should look for chocolate. I happily found this small bar (a bit pricey) in a souvenir shop at Bangkok airport.

The wrapper mentions a "Chumphon" cocoa. I need to investigate. In any case, it's an intense chocolate leaning toward fruity notes, with reminders of black cherry, red wine, but also coconut and blood orange.

It's a fine experience, a high-level bar — it was awarded Bronze at the Chocolate Awards Asia-Pacific in 2020.
