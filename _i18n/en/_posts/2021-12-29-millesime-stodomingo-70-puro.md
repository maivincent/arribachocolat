I need to put the review of this chocolate in its context. I first tasted this chocolate 1) after a bad memory of the price (we hadn't looked at the price before buying it... $8 for 30g) and 2) while talking to some Ecuadorian friends about the chocolate delights of their country. My first impression was quite bad. Above all, I felt an earthy and bitter taste that remained in my mouth. A disappointment that also fueled the speech we had...

Fortunately, some remained, and I had the opportunity to taste it again, hoping to be more neutral.
First, it's true that this chocolate is more bitter than the others. Especially after a few seconds in the mouth. And that bitterness is what remains in the mouth after letting it melt on the tongue.
However, it must be recognized that it also has a fine taste that evolves alongside the bitterness, and reminds that of Republica Del Cacao. A little butter side, nutty notes too. These flavors stand out more when you take a significant quantity in one go and eat it quickly, because the bitterness does not cover everything. The taste does not remain. It's a pity however, considering the cost of the bar, not to be able to savor it little by little and enjoy a long taste in the mouth. 
It' s definitely a quality chocolate, but really made for bitterness lovers.
And I must admit that it is not my favorite... Good for my wallet!
