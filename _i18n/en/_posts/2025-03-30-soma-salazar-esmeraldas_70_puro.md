Soma is a Toronto chocolatier working with plantations in South America and Africa. With the Costa Esmeraldas bar, a yellow Nacional-Venezuelan cacao is showcased.

This is a warm and complex chocolate with flavors of fresh bread, grapefruit, banana and rosemary. Delicate and creamy, it reveals its notes better when slowly melted on the tongue. Once swallowed, a small lingering memory remains.

A very interesting creation by a Canadian chocolatier that highlights Ecuadorian cacao!
