Quinoa is a cereal from Latin America that comes in small circular grains. While some put puffed rice in their chocolates, Republica del Cacao chose to stay local.
So in this chocolate, we find dried quinoa seeds. Since quinoa has a rather weak taste, especially when it is dry, the interest is more in the texture than in the flavor. The taste of this chocolate is very classic Republica del Cacao, it's probably their "basic" dark chocolate, the one used for chocolates with other ingredients. That doesn't mean it's not good! With a high concentration of cocoa, it's a pretty aggressive chocolate, with a woody taste and a touch of bitterness at the end. The quinoa is mostly there for the texture, which adds crunch when you start a square, and stays in your mouth once the chocolate has melted on your tongue, to make the pleasure last by bursting those little grains between your teeth.

A chocolate in the pure line of Republica del Cacao, which remains very classic in taste while bringing a touch of fantasy in the texture.
