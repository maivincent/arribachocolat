This article has a special format, where I will compare two 75% chocolates from Republica del Cacao.
On the already known side, it is the Provincia Manabi - 75% Fine Cacao. On the new side, it's the Single Origin Ecuador 75% Dark Chocolate, a chocolate that doesn't come from a particular province, and probably the one used when combined with flavors like Quinoa, Red Pepper or Lemon Grass (see below).
The rules of the game: two pieces per chocolate. We start with one at random, and alternate. In the end, there is no winner, except the taster!

It's Ecuador that starts, with a square that reminds me strangely of CÃ´te d'Or, but a bit more subtle, with a little taste of tea.  A soft dark chocolate, not very bitter, with a rich and creamy taste.
Manabi's answer: a more intense, fruity square, stronger at first. It tastes a little more sunny, warm.
Counter attack of the first, which takes several bites because the taste is less strong. The transition is difficult, because it is hidden behind the previous one. But finally, we feel the flavors that remain in the mouth: sweet, reassuring, a little caramel side.
Last action of Manabi; which takes again its frontal attack but with more subtlety. We taste all at once the floral and spicy perfumes. But little flavor, once the chocolate swallowed!
