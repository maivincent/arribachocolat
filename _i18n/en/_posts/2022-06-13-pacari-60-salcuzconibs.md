Another inspired mix from Pacari. Salt in chocolate is a classic: it brings out certain aspects of the chocolate and shifts its balance. It becomes rounder, leaning more toward caramel notes. The salt also brings a peanut-like accent, oddly reminding me of an Oh Henry! candy bar.
The little cocoa nibs mostly add a bit of unpredictability when you bite into the crunchy bits: will it be a salt crystal or a fragment of cocoa bean?

A successful combination, and another direction from Pacari that once again demonstrates the range of flavors achievable with their fine chocolate.
