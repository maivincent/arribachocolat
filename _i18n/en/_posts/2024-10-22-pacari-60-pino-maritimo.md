Maritime pine originates from the Mediterranean basin and is cultivated for its wood. It may also be found in Chile as an invasive species. Its essence is sometimes used in cough syrups. How Pacari decided to use it in a chocolate is a curiosity.

In any case, it's a success. The pine flavor accompanies Pacari's chocolate gently. One senses a freshness that, in a much more discreet way, recalls eucalyptus.

As always, Pacari masters surprising blends. The team developing new tablets is very skilled — hats off to them.
