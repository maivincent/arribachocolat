This is a full-bodied chocolate that does not hide its power. It assumes its place as the most bitter chocolate of the Republica del Cacao brand. It's interesting: often, arriba cocoa is known for its dark chocolates without bitterness. But here we see that it can also compete in this area. Behind this pronounced trait, we can guess a flavor of bark and coffee.
A chocolate that distinguishes itself by its intensity and bitterness, for those who like this character trait.
