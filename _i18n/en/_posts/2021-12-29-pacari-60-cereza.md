I really like cherries. And I really like chocolate (yep!). So it was with high expectations that I opened the case of this bar.
Maybe a little too many hopes, in fact. Because cherries, to be tasty, must be fresh. For obvious reasons, in this chocolate, they are rather dried. 
So we have a chocolate that is very normal for Pacari - its base is always excellent - and at the end, when it has melted, there are little bits of dried cherry left in the mouth that taste very light. It's a bit disappointing.
