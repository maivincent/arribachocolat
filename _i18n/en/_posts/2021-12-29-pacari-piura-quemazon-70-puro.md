Another very special bar. Piura is in Peru - so it is outside the usual borders of Pacari, which usually focuses on Ecuador.
More special: in the Piura region there are albino cocoa trees, i.e. with white seeds (as opposed to the usual red/brown). [Research](https://www.aruntamchocolate.com/en/shop/the-faces-of-the-world/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Braw-nacional-blanco-peru/) has shown that this is a Nacional cocoa, of the same family as the Ecuadorian. In short, a unique cocoa.

Quemazon means that the cocoa has been roasted, which is also unusual for Pacari, who often prefers to skip this step in order to preserve the full taste of the cocoa.

The result?
A richly flavored chocolate that melts slowly on the tongue. Very robust, due to the grilling process among other things, it also has caramel and dried apricot flavors. The taste lives for a long time and ends with a note of sesame.
It is a unique chocolate because of its origins, and excellent because of its quality and finesse. Since it is roasted, however, it is reminiscent of more classic chocolates such as the dark CÃ´te d'Or. 
It is therefore an ideal choice to complete a collection of quality chocolates, but perhaps not the first to be offered to demonstrate the uniqueness of Pacari chocolates.
