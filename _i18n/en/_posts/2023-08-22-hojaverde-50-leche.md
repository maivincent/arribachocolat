Milk chocolate doesn't get much positive reviews on this blog. Not that I don't like it - I have a rather sweet tooth - but the addition of milk risks hiding the subtleties of the cocoa.

Hoja Verde does pretty well under the circumstances. It's an original chocolate, with a hint of mint and hazelnut. Very pleasant!
