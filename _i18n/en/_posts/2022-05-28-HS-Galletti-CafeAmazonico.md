Ecuador is known for its chocolate, but also its coffee!
As the readers of this blog know, coffee is not my cup of tea. However, I have a few connoisseur friends, to whom I brought back some beans and proposed a small special post.
So here is a review of Galletti's Café Amazónico:

`The Galleti amazónico coffee that the author of this blog brought me back as a gift from Ecuador is a real treat. When finely ground (but not too finely!) and extracted for espresso, the moderately roasted beans reveal precise notes of chocolate and cane sugar (almost caramel) without sacrificing the roundness of the coffee. Even after several cups, however, I couldn't taste the citrus notes described on the package. I guess they got lost during the trip. So it will be more up to me to go find them at home one day!`

I hope to bring you more, to accompany you in Ecuador, and who knows, to diversify the subjects and the authors of this blog!
