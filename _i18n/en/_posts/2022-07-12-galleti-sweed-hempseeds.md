A box with cannabis leaves. An evocative name - sweed. But don't worry: there's nothing mind-blowing about this Galletti chocolate. The hemp seeds do give a unique bitter aftertaste to each bite... but I can't say it's pleasant.
As for the chocolate, it's not particularly remarkable.

The Galletti strawberry and raspberry chocolate was a sweet little treat. This one is equally lacking in finesse, but is not as gourmand.
