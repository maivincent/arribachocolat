Vinces is the capital of the province of Los Rios. Known as "Little Paris", in the 19th century it was the center of a golden age of cocoa. Its farms were among the most important in the world and its elite traveled to Europe, and France in particular, bringing back luxury tastes and objects.
It is in honor of this history that Republica del Cacao makes this chocolate in collaboration with the community of Vinces.
It is a chocolate with character, strong in the mouth, very dark, but without a touch of bitterness. In its slightly malty depth, we find touches of honey, hazelnut and pecan. In terms of consistency, it melts quickly and smoothly, leaving time to explore all its nuances. 

A very good dark chocolate, to be tasted by all chocolate lovers!
