I found this bar in the souvenir shop of the Napo Cultural Center, located in Yasuni National Park, within the Kichwa Añangu community deep in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In a thatched hut, tucked among beautiful handmade jewelry by indigenous women, a small foil-wrapped package.

At opening, the aroma is striking—powerful fruity notes. In the mouth, you need to wait: this chocolate is very firm, low in cocoa butter, and does not melt quickly. Perhaps by design: it survived several days in the jungle heat.

The flavor takes time to develop but is powerful, pure, almost wild, conveying the depth of Yasuni cacao with notes of cinnamon and apricot. There are also some solid cacao fragments adding a crunchy texture.

The purest chocolate from the Amazon.
