This is a chocolate with surprisingly restrained flavor, not helped by the delicate physical nature of the bar.
By letting it melt slowly in the mouth, one can extract slightly bitter notes of walnut and rind, followed by subtle caramel and a small touch of acidity.

A refined bar that lacks power.
