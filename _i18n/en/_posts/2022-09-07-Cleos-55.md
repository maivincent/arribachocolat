This bar, the sweetest offered by Cleo's, tries to put forward the specific notes of Sacha cocoa despite the overly important place taken by sugar. Butter and caramel are well present, in a pleasantly fresh impression.
The delicacy of the cocoa, and even its comforting side, are however undermined by an impression of a cheap treat.
This is not my favorite of the collection.
