It begins with a few strange seconds where we do not know what we have in the mouth, before the taste of chocolate finally appears. Then come the acidulous and bitter notes, which hide the floral and fruity side of the nacional cocoa. As a result, it is difficult to detect any other nuances.
What a pity: while the social initiative of the French company is interesting, the bar does not honor the potential of Ecuadorian cocoa... as it is often the case with foreign chocolate makers (except Legast).
