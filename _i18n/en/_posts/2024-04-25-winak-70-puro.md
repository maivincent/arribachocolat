This is the second Wiñak bar I've tried, and it's once again an extraordinary chocolate. It's fairly gentle yet complex, herbal like a fine black tea, with comforting notes of cream and pecan, and touches of salted caramel and malt. It lingers long in the mouth, unfolding a symphony of flavors. A magnificent chocolate, thanks to the Kichwa of the Río Napo.
