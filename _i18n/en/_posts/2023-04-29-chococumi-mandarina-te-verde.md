This is a chocolate that gives much more space to the added flavors than to the cocoa. The essence of mandarin, in particular, is very strong, and leaves no room for the cocoa arriba to express itself.
A good tangerine treat, but hard to distinguish from a supermarket orange chocolate, except for a bit of bitterness at the end. A pity.
