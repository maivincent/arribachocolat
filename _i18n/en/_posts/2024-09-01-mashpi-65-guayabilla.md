The fruit of the plant known by the Latin name Eugenia victoriana has no official English name; I'll call it guayabilla for this article. It's a small orange local fruit, about the size of a closed fist, with pulpy and slightly tart flesh.

There is no need to praise Mashpi's chocolate here: the cocoa remains intense, rich and unique, making this bar extraordinary on its own. The guayabilla, present as small dried pieces, brings a light tartness and some texture. It's pleasant but doesn't fundamentally change the experience.
