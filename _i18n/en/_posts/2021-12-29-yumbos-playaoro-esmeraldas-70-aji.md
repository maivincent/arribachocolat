Once again, Yumbos seems to offer a brittle chocolate, which hardly melts in the mouth. I think this is a real shame because it prevents you from feeling all the flavors of the chocolate.
If you make an effort, you can feel that the chili is definitely present. It stings a bit and gives flavor and a little power. It is not dominant, and that's okay: the finesse of the Playa de Oro chocolate (see [this post](/arribachocolat/en/2021/12/29/yumbos-playaoro-esmeraldas-70-puro.html)) is still there if you look for it. Surprisingly, it's mostly small grains of salt that take up a lot of space when you find yourself biting into them. I wasn't expecting that, but it's not a bad thing.
In the end, it's a good chocolate, but it's difficult to fully appreciate because of its texture. Too bad!

*Please note* It is possible that the bar I tasted was a bit damaged, so I don't know if my evaluation is accurate.
