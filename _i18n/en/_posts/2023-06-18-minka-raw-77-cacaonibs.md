Minka's Raw 77% chocolate is a little bitter, herbal, with strong notes of pepper supported by the small pieces of roasted cocoa. Added under the bar, they give a crisp, sharp texture that's very pleasant. 

It's a chocolate that, without being the flagship, complements the Minka chocolate collection.
