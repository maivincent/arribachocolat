Pepper and cocoa blend in a unique way: they are so close that they combine as one new flavor. That's the first impression when tasting this chocolate: it's smooth, unique, and tasty. And suddenly, you come across a piece of passion fruit. A sweet, acidic surprise that takes up all the space but only for a few moments. Then, gentle return to the unctuousness of the peppered chocolate.
A unique chocolate for its threefold marriage, with the good intuition to include the passion fruit in the form of small touches. Another masterpiece not to be missed.
