Hoja Verde is an established Ecuadorian chocolate brand, and there are good reasons for that. It's a solid bar: smooth texture, no bitterness, single color taste. Here, there are sides of dried fruit: raisins, figs and dates, which coat a touch of classic cacao arriba caramel from start to finish.
My favorite chocolate? No. But a chocolate that tastes good.
