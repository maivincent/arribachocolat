It is a woody chocolate, with a rather subtle taste behind a pronounced bitterness. You can feel that the cocoa has been roasted, without it reducing the flavor. Images come to me of a stretch of gray road, at the border of the cloud forest and the coast, where the humid smells await us just a little further down, and where a man is watching over some cocoa seeds roasting on the sun-warmed asphalt. It's that kind of chocolate: it takes you on a journey, it reminds you of a particular detail, a detail more spectacular for what it tells than for what it is.
