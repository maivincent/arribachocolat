Asoproaval is a community association of cocoa producers from the village of La Mana in Cotopaxi. It's hard to find much information about them. According to an academic article about their work, they recently organized to create tablets — whereas previously they mainly exported cocoa.

The 54% chocolate bar is quite sweet. The clear presence of cane sugar makes it difficult to identify the cocoa's aromas. However, one recognizes some red fruit notes — strawberry, cherry, raspberry.

A bar that is pleasant to eat, but whose cocoa is hard to appreciate. I hope to find less sweet variants from the same brand!
