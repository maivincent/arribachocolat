A bit stronger than the first Natkaw I tasted (the Frutal 65%), this chocolate from Manabi is just as extraordinary. It has notes of orange blossom water and butter, but also raspberries, strawberries, and banana. In short, the name "frutal" is perfectly adequate. We finish with a little touch of bitterness and caramel.

An excellent chocolate, to taste without hesitation.
