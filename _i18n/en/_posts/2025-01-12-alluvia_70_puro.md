After Thailand and Cambodia, it's Vietnam's turn. Found in a high-end souvenir shop on Dong Khoi street in Ho Chi Minh City, this bar is part of Alluvia's collection that includes pure chocolates as well as ones flavored with local influences.

It's a woody chocolate that recalls red wine and blackberry, but also citrus like orange and kumquat. One also senses pecan and, synesthetically, a mahogany color. Rather intense at first, it softens as it melts, finishing with a small sweet marshmallow note.
