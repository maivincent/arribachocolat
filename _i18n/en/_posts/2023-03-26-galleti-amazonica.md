As usual with Galletti, the additional ingredients are not mixed into the chocolate paste. Instead, they are incorporated in dried pieces, underneath the bar. This separates the taste of the chocolate itself from the added elements.

Galletti's chocolate is not extraordinary. Rather woody and herbal, its taste is neither subtle nor powerful. It is, however, a guilty pleasure when you bite into a slice of dried pineapple. Maracuya is less imposing, but its presence can be detected in small crunchy moments. The guayusa is harder to identify, as my taste buds are not trained for it.
All in all, there's a hint of the tropics, making for a very pleasant whole.
