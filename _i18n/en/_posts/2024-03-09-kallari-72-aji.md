This is a very mild chocolate whose flavor takes its time to express itself. You need to let it melt to begin sensing the nuances.
You can find the lightness and finesse of Kallari's Sacha cacao, accompanied by a touch of hot pepper — which primarily lends flavor rather than heat.
The taste lingers on the palate long after tasting, providing a comforting presence.

Fine and pleasant chocolate, though it could benefit from greater intensity to be appreciated from the first bite. I noticed that eating several pieces in a row and letting them melt one by one helps to enjoy it more.
