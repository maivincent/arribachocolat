From the name on the label - "Grand Cru" - to the presentation of the packaging - band, case, and four neatly sculpted individual bars - Durca is a brand aiming to convey luxury, elegance, and exclusivity.

The chocolate itself is interesting. It has an identity - a strong fig flavor, with herbal notes of rosemary, sage and bay leaf. Despite a somewhat austere character, it remains quite unique, fine, and overall a nice experience.

Durca’s 70% from Napo shows an interesting combination of roasted cocoa, cocoa nibs, and a vegetal undertone that suggests wet forest notes. There are subtle citrus top notes that brighten the profile and balance the earthier components. Texture is firm and satisfying.

From the label's name — "Grand Cru" — to the packaging presentation — band, case, and four well-sculpted individual bars — Durca is a brand that seeks to convey luxury, elegance and exclusivity. I bought it at the Cacao & Cacao shop in Quito, though I don't recall if the price was higher than other bars.

The chocolate itself is interesting. It has a distinct identity — a strong fig flavor with herbal notes of rosemary, sage and bay. Despite a somewhat austere character, it remains unique, refined, and overall a fine experience.
