La Chocolaterie du Village mentioned in the October 5 post does not only sell Ecuadorian chocolate. Anticipating a trip to Vietnam, my friend brought this small bar back. The design is very pretty; the uneven thickness squares are engraved with tropical flowers.

The chocolate itself is powerful. A bit acidic, it shows notes of licorice, buckwheat honey and molasses, flavors I had not often encountered in the Ecuadorian chocolate catalog.

It's a very high-quality chocolate!
