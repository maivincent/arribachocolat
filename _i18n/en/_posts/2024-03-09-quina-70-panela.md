What a strange chocolate. It begins with a somewhat burnt, unpromising note and a sandy texture somewhat like a maple candy. But as it develops, notes of jasmine, violet and incense fill the mouth, to the point where it's hard to believe no flavor was added. A slight sweet-butter flavor accompanies everything.

An absolutely unique chocolate that again demonstrates the immense variety of flavors offered by Ecuadorian cacao.
