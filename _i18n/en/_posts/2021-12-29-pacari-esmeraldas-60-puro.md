I tasted this chocolate a little after having tasted the one made by [Millésime from Ecuadorian cocoa](/en/millésime/2021/12/29/millesime-stodomingo-70-puro.html). The difference is obvious! Here, we have a gentle and comforting chocolate, which knows how to play in the tones of dark chocolate. It is a fruity, floral chocolate, whose taste however does not last very long after it has melted in the mouth. 
The perfect example of what a dark chocolate can offer, in terms of pleasure and subtlety, comfort and finesse. A great chocolate!

Note: Esmeraldas is a large region northwest of Quito, and it runs from the Pacific Ocean to the foot of the Andes.
