Light and fruity, this Yaussa chocolate is reminiscent of banana, maple syrup, with hints of vanilla and malt. The texture is firm, yet smooth and gently melting. This is a chocolate that is clearly out of the ordinary thanks to a well-controlled difference.
However, I am disappointed that sweeteners replace sugar: at the risk of falling into the trap of confirmation bias, I find in the taste an artificial je-ne-sais-quoi.
Too bad, because it is otherwise an excellent chocolate!
