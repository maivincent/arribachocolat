Nat Kaw strikes once again, with a bar of great finesse. There are amazing hints of tea, whiskey, and black pepper, all blended into a smooth and soft chocolate. A taste that hovers on the tongue and palate for several seconds.

This bar won the Gran Ero of the Ecuador Chocolate Awards in 2021. It is clearly deserved.
