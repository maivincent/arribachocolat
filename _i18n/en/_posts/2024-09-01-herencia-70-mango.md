Herencia continues its exploration by embedding pieces of dried mango under the bar. The chocolate takes its time to reveal its colors: you must let it melt to distinguish the multiple facets that make a "pure" bar such a good chocolate. The mango pieces remain in the mouth and add a small tropical color and firmer texture. They take longer to reveal themselves: dry, they only release a tart flavor as the chocolate melts. It's only after swallowing that the tiny bits clinging to the teeth finally allow recognition of the fruit's essence.

It's a good chocolate — Herencia's cocoa is of solid quality — but working with dried mango seems to be a tricky exercise.
