Panela is a type of molasses, made from sugar cane, and common in Latin America. 
With this chocolate, Mindo puts forward this unrefined ingredient, whose taste resembles, for the Quebecers, that of the Ste-Catherine taffy.

And, as usual, it is a success. The tastes of chocolate and panela blend harmoniously. The nuances of cocoa, in the background, support a unique and comforting experience.

A unique and pleasant treat, under the seal of Mindo Chocolate's excellence.
