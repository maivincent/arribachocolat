Another chocolate from Lua, all in little touches, as if painted by a pointillist artist. Very gentle — give it time to reveal itself, and the delicate flavor touches emerge one by one.

Opening with wood and bark, it evolves toward peppermint, honey, and finishes with a surprising hint of cola.

I repeat: it's very, very gentle. But by letting the velvety squares melt slowly you'll find fine subtleties.
