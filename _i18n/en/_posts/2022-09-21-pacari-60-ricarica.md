The [rica rica](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acantholippia_deserticola), generic name of the Acantholippia deserticola, is an aromatic plant from the Andean high plateau. This is the first time I've tasted it, and it's hard to separate it from the taste of cocoa.
In any case, we have a chocolate with a herbal flavor. Here, no butter or caramel, no fruity acidity. Rather, a herbal side and a certain lightness.
