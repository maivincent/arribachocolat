Plukenetia volubilis, also known as sacha inchi, is native to South America; its roasted seeds resemble peanuts. That's primarily what you taste in this bar, while the Kallari chocolate itself remains fairly restrained. The sacha inchi pieces, scattered as fragments, bring a peanut-like flavor—just different enough from familiar peanuts to pique curiosity. Slightly more herbaceous, maybe a touch rancio, but overall pleasant.

An original chocolate worth trying!
