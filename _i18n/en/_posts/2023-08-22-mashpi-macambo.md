What is macambo?
It's a cousin of cocoa, as it also belongs to the theobroma genus (Latin for "food of the gods").
You could make macambo chocolate, but it's generally not as good as cocoa chocolate. However, you can put pieces of it in the chocolate: it's then quite similar to pecan.

As always, Mashpi chocolate is extraordinary: it's the same guarantee of quality, whatever the added flavour. The macambo adds a pleasant touch of crunch. A good opportunity to try the cousin of our favorite fruit!
