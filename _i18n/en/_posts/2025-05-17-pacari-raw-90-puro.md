> Note: Raw bars tend to present a more vegetal and astringent profile.

Pacari's 90% raw bar is unapologetically intense. It opens with bold roasted notes, then shifts toward astringent dark fruit and an almost green vegetal edge. The texture is dense and long-lasting on the palate. This is a bar for those who seek extreme cocoa intensity.

The 90% bar sits at the edge of pure cocoa and its intensity, with just enough sweetness to develop flavors. It's a fruity, tangy chocolate—like slightly green apricot or the tiniest blueberries. You also find notes of candied orange, controlled bitterness, and a slight smoky touch.

As usual for Pacari's Raw series, it's an excellent chocolate asserting a strong direction while leaving room for nuance.
