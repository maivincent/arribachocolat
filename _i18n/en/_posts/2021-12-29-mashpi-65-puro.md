This is an excellent chocolate, much more accessible of course than its 100% cousin. 

The consistency is a bit crunchy, but rapidly melting. The advantage is that it gives more time to taste it.
This chocolate starts quickly with flavors of green tea and mint, and evolves on touches of peach and raspberry. We finish on cookie chips. 

All in softness and finesse, it is a chocolate of choice for a tasting and a demonstration of the richness of Arriba cocoa. Worthy to sit next to the best chocolates of this list!
