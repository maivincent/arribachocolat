It's hard to make good chocolate, even with Ecuadorian cocoa.
That's what this small, family-run company, based in the Amazon rainforest, is showing us. On the packaging of this bar, found at the Quito artisanal market, there are no details.
I can tell by the taste that it's milk chocolate.

Taste, in a nutshell? In a blind taste test, I'm not sure I can tell it from a Hershey chocolate.

That's the nature of this adventure of exploration of Ecuadorian chocolate: we hunt for treasures, for gold nuggets, but sometimes we come across pyrite.
