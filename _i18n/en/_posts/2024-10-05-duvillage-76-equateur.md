This bar was offered by a friend from a chocolaterie in Baie St-Paul, in the heart of Charlevoix, Québec. Seeing a bar made with Ecuadorian cocoa, my friend thought of me — many thanks!

It's successful. The bar is nicely decorated and the texture well controlled. The chocolate is gentle, with fruity notes of almond and grapefruit — all balanced with controlled bitterness.

This bar takes advantage of the aromas of fine Ecuadorian cocoa, though it may lack a small unique signature compared to other Ecuadorian chocolates.
