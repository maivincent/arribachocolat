Do you like rosewater?
If so, this chocolate is for you. If not, run away, quickly!

Rose takes center stage. It's the first flavor you taste in the opening moments; it dominates the entire tasting and is the last note that gently lingers on the tongue.

The chocolate supports it, adding depth and stability. The lemon is hard to distinguish except for a small touch of acidity.

An interesting chocolate that can be pleasant for rose lovers, but it doesn't really explore the richness of the cacao.

Note: on the box it is marked 72% everywhere, except on the main title where a sticker was added to correct it to 58%... It's not clear :)
