This is a little treat. 
Dominated by the flavors of strawberries and raspberries, its taste is light and refreshing. The 55% chocolate binds it all together and brings a little warmth. The whole dried fruit slices underneath the bar add a touch of tartness and sweetness, to the delight of the taste buds.

It's hard to appreciate the finesse of aroma fino cacao with this bar, but it's a sure bet to make someone happy. After all, isn't that the primary purpose of chocolate?
