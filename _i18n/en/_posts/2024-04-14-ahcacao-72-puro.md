One last Mexican chocolate — Ah Cacao, found at the Soda Gourmet shop in Tulum, Quintana Roo.

Ah Cacao appears to be well established in Quintana Roo, with several shops in Playa del Carmen, making chocolate from Mexican cacao (their site offers limited details).

Flavor-wise this is a vanilla and biscuit chocolate with low bitterness, fairly classic but showing surprising notes of pear, apple and banana. It's quite different from arriba cacao, but pleasant.
