Don't let your guard down because it's chocolate, and often hot pepper chocolate is just a little extra flavor. When Republica del Cacao says "Hot pepper", that's really what it means.
Don't be fooled by a little piece of the bar that doesn't look any different than any other bar. You'll notice it when you bite into this square that contains a few dry pepper seeds. It's surprising, the first time.

This does not mean that this chocolate is not recommended! On the contrary. To make it easy, the chili pepper adds spice to an otherwise classic 75% dark Republica del Cacao chocolate. This makes this bar quite unique, as it is one of the few chocolates that dares to go so far in the spicy dimension of its flavor. And for those who like it, it's a really good experience!

Recommended if you are in one or more of these three situations:
- you're not afraid of spicy things
- you are curious and have a taste for risk
- you want to give it as a gift to someone without warning, just for fun!
