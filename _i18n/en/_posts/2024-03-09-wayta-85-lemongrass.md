Wayta offers a powerful chocolate here, with intense floral and woody aromas and a light but present bitterness, while an acidity emerges at the end.
The hierba luisa — the equivalent of lemongrass — is present in the background, supporting certain cocoa notes without taking over. It's refreshing because lemongrass chocolates often overemphasize the plant; here the balance is better respected and allows appreciation of the nuances of fine aroma cacao.
