It's not written on the box except in the ingredients, but this chocolate bar is enhanced with pieces of cocoa and grains of salt.

Spicy notes quickly emerge from the chocolate: pink pepper, anise and cinnamon. They wrap around the crunchy texture of the roasted cocoa pieces for a unique experience.
