Similar to the Arariwa with pistachio, almond pieces are incorporated under the bar rather than into the chocolate. The Arariwa 72% chocolate has a perfect texture — smooth, crunchy, melting. The almonds add a little crunch that is not unpleasant. In terms of taste, it is rather light, with woody and caramel notes, though a good level of bitterness hides some of the nuances.

A good chocolate overall; I prefer it to the pistachio one.
