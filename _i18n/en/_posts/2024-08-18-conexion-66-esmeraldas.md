When a square of chocolate melts in the mouth, the nose comes alive to recognize its perfumes. Sometimes they present themselves clearly; other times you must dig deeper, searching for gustatory links to other foods. Often I let my imagination guide the exploration, and when a fruit, herb, or other aroma comes to mind, I try to find the resemblance to what I'm tasting.

Occasionally, though, it's another story. Like with this Conexion chocolate: certain aromas bring back memories and scenes. Here I recall a family evening around the kitchen table in my childhood, a winter night by the window with a radio in the background. The connection? We were eating a pear-and-almond tart from the nearby bakery.

It confirms itself: this intense chocolate shows notes of pear and almonds, and, on further tasting, a slightly acidic honey.

Conexion does not disappoint. Its well-calibrated chocolates travel through different landscapes of flavor and memory — a fine example.
