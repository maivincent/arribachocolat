Sometimes there are little mysteries that spice up everyday life. For example, the fact that I waited until February 9, 2022 to write about this chocolate, which is a classic for me, and a first choice for gift giving. It was while doing the translations that I realized this!

The maracuya is a subspecies of the passion fruit. It's a very pretty name - my grandfather named his little sailboat after it. Pacari offers a warm and balanced chocolate here. The acidity of the maracuya mingles with the roundness of the cocoa for a major accord, which, after an intense strike, resonates for a long time in the palate, uncovering little by little new notes as the chocolate melts.

This is one of the best, if not the best, chocolates with added flavor from Pacari.
