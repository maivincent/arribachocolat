title:  "Raw Chocolate Organico - 100% Cacao"
tags: [Pacari, Dark, Pure]

Like many 100% cocoa chocolates, this bar has a powerful and marked presence in the mouth, but as is often the case with arriba cocoa, it is not particularly bitter. However, Pacari manages to avoid a common pitfall with 100%: this chocolate is less doughy than its counterparts.
In more detail, one can appreciate the notes of roasted nuts and a little acidity and bitterness that are characteristic of Pacari. It is an important experience: one understands what makes the basis of other chocolates.
In itself, it is a very pleasant chocolate, although it should be reserved for those who are looking for it.
