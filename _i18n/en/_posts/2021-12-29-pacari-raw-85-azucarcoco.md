title:  "Pacari - Raw Chocolate Organico - 85% Cacao + Azucar de coco"
tags: [Dark, Pure, Coconut sugar]

Probably made from the same ingredients as the 70%, this chocolate is however more bitter and more acidic. If we find notes of roasted nuts, it is rather an impression of coffee that dominates the flavor. It is a powerful chocolate, which quickly invades the palate, and remains long in mouth. The coconut sugar appears towards the end, and refocuses the trajectory towards the subtle touches of caramel and vanilla characteristic of Pacari chocolate.

A chocolate for the experienced connoisseur, who is looking for the intensity of a dark chocolate without complexes.
