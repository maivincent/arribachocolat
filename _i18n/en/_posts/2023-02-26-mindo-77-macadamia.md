Underneath this bar of Mindo chocolate (yes, you know, that extraordinary base), we add small slivers of caramelized macadamia nuts. The result is a crunchy, sweet confection that's more gourmand than gourmet.

A big difference from the original Mindo chocolate? No. But it's still an excellent bar, as always.
