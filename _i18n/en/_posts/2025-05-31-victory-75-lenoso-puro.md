This is a rather raw chocolate, not very sweet, which seems to delegate to the taster the work of appreciating it. It's worth the effort - with a little patience and imagination, one understands the "woody" categorization, well chosen for this chocolate: notes of pine, eucalyptus, boreal forest after the rain.

Generally pleasant.

Victory's 75% showcases a deep roasted cocoa character with notes of coffee, dark molasses, and a leathery (lenoso) accent that gives the bar a classic, mature profile. The mouthfeel is dense and the finish lingers with roasted bitters.

This is a rather raw, lightly sweetened chocolate that seems to delegate the work of appreciation to the taster. It's worth the effort— with patience and imagination one understands the "woody" label, well chosen for this bar: notes of pine, eucalyptus, and a boreal-forest-after-rain feel emerge.

Generally pleasant.
