Wat is a Cambodian chocolate brand. In a beautiful but challenging country, it's a luxury product prized by tourists.

A powerful, rather bitter chocolate with subtle notes of raspberry and thyme. It melts slowly on the tongue.

It's good, high-quality chocolate. In my view, however, it doesn't demonstrate a distinctive originality or signature that really stands out.
