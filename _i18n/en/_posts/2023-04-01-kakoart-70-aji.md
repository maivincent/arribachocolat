This chocolate is not from Ecuador, but from Costa Rica. It's a trinitario cocoa, with a different aroma to the Ecuadorian nacional. It was a gift from a close friend who had just returned from this country, and whom I thank!

The herbal side of this bar is strangely reminiscent of herbes de provence, with a woody background and hints of eucalyptus. These are complemented by the chili pepper, which is more noticeable at the end, with a taste that lingers on the palate.

This is truly an interesting chocolate, with an evolution of flavors throughout the tasting. All it lacks, perhaps, is a little warmth.
