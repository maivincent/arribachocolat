This is completely Pacari chocolate. It seems to me that this is the same base from which chocolates with other ingredients are made (except that here it is 70% instead of 60%).
So we have a smooth, creamy, well-balanced chocolate. It starts with hints of wood and roasted nuts and finishes with flavors of caramel, vanilla and cinnamon. It hides a very small bitterness behind a powerful and long lasting taste.
A classic that will appeal to everyone, playing brilliantly on all fronts.
