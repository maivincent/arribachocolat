Here's another European chocolatier offering Ecuadorian cocoa.
The bar is thick, the texture silky, the color uniform and deep.

Taste-wise, we find some of the characteristic touches of arriba cocoa, especially in its woody accents, with colors of tea and hazelnut. The bitterness is quite present, which is not surprising for a European brand.

This chocolate is good. It reminds me of the more robust Republica del Cacao chocolates, Los Rios 75% or Hacienda la Concepcion 85%. It does not, however, exploit the unique, nuanced flavors of Ecuadorian cocoa to their full potential.
