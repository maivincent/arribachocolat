This is another tablet provided in preview by the store Cacao & Cacao, located in Quito on Juan Leon Mera Avenue. A big thank you!

It is a soft and smooth chocolate. The first few seconds remind me in flash of my mother's date and honey cakes, nostalgic touches that are quickly cleaned up by a woody wave and a slight bitterness. 

A nice bar, to add in the palette of Ecuadorian chocolate flavors.
