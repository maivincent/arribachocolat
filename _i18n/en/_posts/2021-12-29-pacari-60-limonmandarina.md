This chocolate from Pacari won the Gold Award at the 2019 International Chocolate Awards in the Americas category.
Contrary to what you might expect, the bitter orange doesn't really add any bitterness to the chocolate. Instead, it is very sweet and almost refreshing. A bit acidic, it is a pleasant and light blend, a sure but original value that probably explains the distinction won by this chocolate!
