Chocho is a legume, also called lupine in English, which is popular in some parts of Latin America, such as Ecuador. 
Mashpi's chocolate is, as usual, extraordinary. Floral, fruity, powerful but also sweet and without a hint of bitterness, it is without question among the best.

Without a comparison at hand though, I have a hard time determining the influence of chocho in this chocolate. It's very possible that the cocoa and lupine flavors blend together so well that I can't distinguish. This is a chocolate described as semi-dark, but with no percentage listed: is the chocho replacing the milk, bringing a discreet touch of vegan sweetness to the bar?
It is, in any case, a delicious bar.
