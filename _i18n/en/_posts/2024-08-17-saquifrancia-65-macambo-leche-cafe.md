Finca Saquifrancia offers unique experiences. After the tobacco-vanilla combo, here comes macambo-coffee. Macambo is not cocoa; it's a closely related species that can be used to make bars with a chocolate-like texture and taste. I had tried it before with the Monarque brand.

This thick bar strikes strongly from the start with an intense coffee flavor. Although I'm not a big fan of coffee, the sweet coating and the milk soften it and make it pleasant. The macambo then stands out: while it recalls cocoa at first, it finishes with a light acidity.

This is an extraordinary bar in the primary sense of the word and makes me want to try more of Finca Saquifrancia's creations.
