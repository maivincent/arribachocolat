In Kischwa, banana is said: guiña, hence the name of this chocolate bar. 
The Sacha cocoa, which constitutes the base of this chocolate, has a rather light taste, rather buttery and minty. In this bar, they added banana essence, dried banana flakes, and a little salt. The result? A somewhat peculiar mixture, which seems to be a little unsure of itself because the natural banana aroma is very pronounced, which hides the too subtle richness of the chocolate. The taste that remains in the mouth is reminiscent of a bad banana candy.

It's a shame, because the effort and the quality of the ingredients are there. It's just a risky combination, and, perhaps, a little bit too much of banana essence.
