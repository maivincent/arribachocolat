Minka's Raw range often conveys seriousness: low sugar, intense chocolate, slightly bitter with notes of tea and pepper. This bar is no exception.

Don't let that stop you from trying it! The ginger, added beneath the bar, plays an important role from the first bite. Tea, pepper, ginger — it's a successful blend reminiscent of chais and it works wonderfully here.

Minka offers sober yet brilliant chocolate, a fine addition to their Raw collection.
