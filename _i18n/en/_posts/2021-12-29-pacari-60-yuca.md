(Note: the bar I'm trying is too old and the chocolate has spoiled over time. I will try to go over it and imagine a fresh bar - but the evaluation obviously suffers, both in texture and taste).

It's a rather peculiar attempt that Pacari is trying with this yuca (also known as cassava) chocolate. It is difficult to combine the tuberous taste of yuca with a sweet treat. The result is a somewhat doughy mixture. I'm exaggerating a bit, but it's a bit like having chocolate potato chips: it can be pleasant if it's well done, but it's not an instinctively appealing association.

An interesting experience then, but to put in the peripheral category of "well tried".
