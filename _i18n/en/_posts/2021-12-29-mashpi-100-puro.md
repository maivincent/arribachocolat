100%? 100% cocoa? It's supposed to be bitter, too bitter to enjoy, right?

Well, not quite. In fact, this chocolate is proof of the opposite. Warning: it's not sweet. But, if you're looking to try and understand what makes arriba cacao and Ecuadorian chocolate so good, this is the perfect bar.
This chocolate has a bold taste of wood and nuts. A strong and fine aroma, hardly bitter, reminiscent of the smells of the humid and warm forests where this cocoa grows. 

Tips: to be eaten in very small pieces, as the taste takes up a lot of space in the mouth, and the intensity of the chocolate dries up the saliva. It's also worth having a glass of water nearby!

A necessary experience for any serious chocolate enthusiast, who will appreciate this bar for what it represents: a perfect example of the finesse of arriba chocolate. You have to know what to expect though, as this is not a bar that will please everyone - avoid giving it as a gift as a first bar of Ecuadorian chocolate...!
