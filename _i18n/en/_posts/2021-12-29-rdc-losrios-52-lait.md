This is a slightly more interesting chocolate than the 40% milk. There is enough cocoa in it to detect the characteristic touches of Republica del Cacao. Despite this, the milk still erases the subtle notes that make the particular value of arriba cocoa. It is a pity, even if it is a very pleasant chocolate, and of good quality.

Note that this is the base chocolate of several bars of Republica del Caca that align it with different flavors, relying on the new ingredients for the originality component.
