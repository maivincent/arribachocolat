Another sweet bar, rounder and softer than the Inca berry one. The banana-chocolate duo is a classic, and for a good reason: these two flavors blend particularly well. When the cocoa is as good as Republica del Cacao's arriba cocoa, it is unmistakably delicious. The fine pieces of dried banana melt more slowly than the chocolate in the mouth. The bar can be enjoyed in two stages: letting the chocolate melt gently, and enjoying the sweet and crunchy elements at the end.
