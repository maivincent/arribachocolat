The jaguar on the packaging is representative of this chocolate. Yasuni, a jewel of Amazonian biodiversity threatened by oil, brings a powerful, wild cocoa here. You sense humidity, lush vegetation, the richness and complexity of the rainforest, with woody and smoky notes, butter, and also a citrus-zest bitterness.
