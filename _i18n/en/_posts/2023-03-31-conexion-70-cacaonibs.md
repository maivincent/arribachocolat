Conexion offers us a very good bar. It's a pure, smooth chocolate, with a caramel taste, a touch of acidity reminiscent of rhubarb and a hint of bitterness, just to deserve its 70%.

The cocoa pieces, numerous and crunchy, are incorporated under the bar. They add an interesting textural element, as well as a fragrant, woody edge.

This is the first Conexion bar I've tried, and it's clearly a good impression. It heralds a brand that, while not the leader, is among the front runners.
