Mindo Chocolate knows how to make chocolate. Let's start with the texture: perfectly smooth, gently crunchy before slowly melting, rich but light. Then the taste: in the first few seconds, it fills the mouth with warm notes. Slowly, woody, leafy, barky and honey flavors unfold. Then, as it begins to melt, tones of butter and almond join in. It finally disappears, leaving the impression of having taken a sip of an excellent hot chocolate.

A masterpiece of chocolate.
