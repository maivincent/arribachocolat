Bios is one of Ecuador's more established chocolate brands. Often their chocolate is of average quality and sold at a low price, and my previous tries hadn't convinced me to cover them here. So I was surprised to learn this new bar won Gold at the Ecuadorian Chocolate Awards in 2023.

Indeed, it's interesting. Here there's nothing but cocoa — no additives, and notably no sugar: cocoa pulp powder, or mucilage, is used to sweeten the bar. And it works well!

It's a rather unique chocolate: the mucilage's fruity and tart side is present, and despite less finesse than usual on this blog, the cocoa brings roundness with woodier, almost smoky notes for a pleasant and surprising mix.

A fine success! I hope Bios builds on it.
