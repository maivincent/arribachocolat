Marou is a Vietnamese fine chocolate brand with shops in several tourist spots. This bar was bought in Hanoi. Because they're rather expensive, I had to be reasonable and choose only one of the six single-origin dark chocolate bars from different Vietnamese regions. Bà Ria is located southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, on the South China Sea coast.

This is an intensely flavored chocolate that showcases the chocolatiers' mastery. Its flavors evolve, touching the acidity of strawberry and passion fruit, the gentle bitterness of almond and gin, and the aromas of licorice and cinnamon.

By personal preference it may not be my absolute favorite among all the chocolates I know, but I recognize the quality of the work and I'm eager to try the other bars from the brand!
