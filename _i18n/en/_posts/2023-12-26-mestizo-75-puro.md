It's a beautiful chocolate bar with a deep hue. The texture is silky, despite a slightly rough edge. The flavor quickly becomes powerful. The initial impression is that it's an excellent... but classic chocolate. A delicious brownie taste, very pleasant and warm but not particularly unique. However, when you take the time, you discover rare hints of strawberry and lemon, showcasing the finesse of the cocoa used.

It's a fine aroma cocoa, meaning not an "arriba." But it remains a bar of great quality.
