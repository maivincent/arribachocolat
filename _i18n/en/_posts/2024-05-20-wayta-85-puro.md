Imagine walking into an Amazonian forest clearing, the sun beating down and heavy humidity — then stepping into cool shade under dense foliage, a small bench, colorful birds singing, and you are offered a piece of chocolate. This Wayta bar is much like that: dense and smooth, rich and refreshing, a concentrate of forest flavors from woody to floral, herbal to fruity.

An excellent chocolate that brings you back to its Amazonian origins.
