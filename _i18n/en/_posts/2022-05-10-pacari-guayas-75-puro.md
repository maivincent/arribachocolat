Dark and deep, yet floral and sweet. At first, notes of wine red and violet blue, then comes a heart of caramel and banana, for a light woody finish that stays on the palate.
As Pacari knows how to do, this is a balanced chocolate, where each color is precisely calibrated, in a smooth and melting chocolate. A chocolate designed for competition.
