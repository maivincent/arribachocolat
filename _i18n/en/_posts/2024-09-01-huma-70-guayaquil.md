Oh wow!

Another excellent chocolate from Huma, which reveals new flavors I didn't know were accessible from cocoa. Here you find marzipan, raisin and pear in an ensemble that is warm yet fresh, rich yet light, unique yet familiar, firm yet melting — in short, a delight of nuance and mastery.

This is a favorite and one of the best Ecuadorian chocolates.
