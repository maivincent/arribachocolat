Note to self: 100% chocolates should be rated in a special category.
When you buy a bar of them, you're not expecting a gourmet, comfortable bar. You know you won't have to discipline yourself not to finish it in a few minutes.
Instead, you want a pure, honest experience of the finesse of cocoa and the expertise of the chocolatier. Not hidden behind fruit or spice, not disguised by sugar, cocoa butter or milk, cocoa expresses itself completely.

The cocoa here is woody and dry. You have to wait a few seconds for the nuances to appear: hazelnut, paprika, leather, with bitterness and acidity present but controlled.

The texture of this chocolate is pleasant, and doesn't dry out the mouth too much, which is always a challenge for 100% tablets. Still, after a few pieces, you feel like having a glass of water or milk!
