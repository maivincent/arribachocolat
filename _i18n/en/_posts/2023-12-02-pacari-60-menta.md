Mint chocolate... What could be more classic? Did I hear you say After Eight?

Wait, here we're talking about "Andean mint," called mu√±a or tipo. I won't hide my botanical ignorance, which prevents me from interpreting the information gathered on Wikipedia correctly: does minthostachys mollis belong to the mentha genus, or is it a close cousin?

Nevertheless, it's airy, less herbal or icy than more common mints. This, combined with Nacional cocoa and Pacari chocolate, offers a unique, finer experience than an After Eight.

The best Ecuadorian chocolate? No.
The best Pacari chocolate? Not quite.
The best mint chocolate I've tasted? Yes, indeed.

(Well, only if it's really mint.)
