tags: [Pacari, Dark, Pepper]

With this chocolate, Pacari takes the gamble of sweet pepper. It's a success: without stinging, you can feel the pepper's aroma mingling with the chocolate's. The two flavors are on the same front, but they blend surprisingly well, so that it is difficult to distinguish one from the other. This is the strength of this bar: the balance achieved gives the impression of tasting something new, in the middle of a spectrum that would be continuous between pepper and cocoa.
It is therefore a chocolate that takes advantage of the finesse and subtlety of its cocoa to marry it rather than to enjoy it as such.  
Note: this chocolate won the Silver Award at the International Chocolate Awards in 2017.
