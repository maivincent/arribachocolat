A visit to Brussels was the occasion to visit several chocolate stores. The brand Pierre Marcolini is among the most famous, and not only for its bonbons: they also sell great grand crus. 
Surprisingly, no chocolate from Ecuador. So I wanted to try something else, that you don't often see: an Indian cocoa, of the Amelonado variety. 

It is a chocolate that takes its time to reveal itself. When the taste appears, it is first bitter like coffee, then turns to a sour side. There is no caramel or butter background that rounds out the experience: it would be rather fruity notes of bergamot, apricot, accompanied by a touch of raisin.

This is clearly a high quality chocolate, but one that confirms my special interest in Ecuadorian chocolate and its floral, airy, overall softer flavors while bringing nuance and diversity.
