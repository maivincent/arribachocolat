Rest assured — this chocolate does not actually contain cannabis. It is topped with hemp seeds placed behind the bar. It's the "mild" counterpart to Kamm's CBD chocolate, a signature of the brand.

Kamm's cocoa is relatively restrained. At first glance the flavor is shy and a bit shadowy, but if you give it time you'll find notes of tea and mandarin.

I'm not sure I can taste the hemp seeds, but perhaps they contribute to this faint herbaceous character.
