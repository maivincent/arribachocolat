Rich, creamy, chocolatey. Yes — a chocolate that tastes of chocolate: I dare say it because that's what comes to mind. This bar does not seek originality in unusual tones; rather it offers the flavors you'd expect from a chocolate gelato or a delicious molten cake, perhaps with a hint of nut or hazelnut. It is, however, its quality — balanced sugar, a well-hidden bitterness in the background, a smooth and creamy chocolate — that makes this Imbabura chocolate stand out.

Another ChocoCumi success.
