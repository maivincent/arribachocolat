A very good surprise. This chocolate from a small agro-tourism farm, bought at a Christmas fair for $2, is one of the best I've tasted (and you know that's saying a lot!).
It's a fruity, slightly tangy intensity that lasts from the first hit to the taste buds to a lingering aftertaste. There are strong tangerine accents, accompanied by notes of creamy honey. A delightful experience.
