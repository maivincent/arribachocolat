First of all, a special thanks to the Cacao & Cacao store located in Quito on Juan Leon Mera Avenue for providing me with a special preview of this chocolate.

In the form of a very thin bar, this chocolate with a smooth texture melts delicately on the tongue. The scent of orange blossom water opens the ball. It remains present until the end, accompanying, in a more or less precise order, butter, caramel, hazelnut, and well controlled touches of acidity and bitterness.  

This is a chocolate that carries the signature of arriba chocolate in its purest form.
