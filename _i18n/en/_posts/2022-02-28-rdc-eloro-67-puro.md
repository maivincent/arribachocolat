El Oro is a coastal region in southern Ecuador, known for its historical gold and current banana production. This chocolate is soft and round. At first, it reminds of black tea, before slowly changing to coffee, caramel and, if you look a little, some apricot notes.
It is a solid and pleasant chocolate, which will delight everyone while having its particular touches.
