The Brunei, or Borneo, cherry does not, as its name suggests, come from Ecuador. It had to be fetched far. But Mashpi did more than that: the cherries are fermented, which brings an unexpected flavor, somewhere between red fruit and wine.

Combined with Mashpi's excellent chocolate, it's a unique experience, making it one of Ecuador's finest chocolate bars.
