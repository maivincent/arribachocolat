When I was a child, anxious thoughts sometimes kept me awake at night. When my mother noticed, she would take me to the kitchen for a glass of milk perfumed with orange blossom water.

This chocolate recalls those comforting memories. The chocolate is dark but its taste is milky and floral. You can also taste clover honey. It's a very pointed and defined flavor, without roundness.

The texture, brittle and not very melting, is a bit less welcoming.
