The box is pretty, but it looks more like an 80s American candy store than a fine chocolate.
And yet. And yet!

Another wonderful surprise, another valiant member of the magnificent family of Ecuadorian chocolates. Beneath a smooth, melt-in-the-mouth texture that's perfectly mastered, we find a light, airy chocolate, with no bitterness whatsoever, and notes of citrus, vanilla and peach. 

It's also worth mentioning that this is a brand that employs people with disabilities. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy an extraordinary chocolate while contributing to the economic inclusion of the most courageous among us.
