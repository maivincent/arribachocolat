This one is a white chocolate special! A little treat that allows us to enjoy a gourmet pleasure without feeling guilty. Indeed, even if it is "only" white chocolate, it has a delicate flavor and the cocoa beans, adding crunch and a little body, give it the legitimacy to be part of the Republica Del Cacao collection.
A good idea to change a little!
