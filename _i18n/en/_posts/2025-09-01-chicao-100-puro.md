Green mint, fir, lemon, bread and butter. The tasting of this 100% chocolate goes through different stages as you let it melt in the mouth or as you eat several pieces.
It's a pleasant chocolate, not bitter at all; on the contrary, it is rich, satisfying, and is enjoyed as you discover its nuances.

Re-reading the description of the Chicao 70% from January 2022, or tasting the two bars one after the other, shows how much sugar changes the notes cocoa plays in a chocolate bar.
