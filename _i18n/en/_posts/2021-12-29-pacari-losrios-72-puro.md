Despite its high percentage, this chocolate is more subtle than full-bodied. Woody and round in the first moments, it delivers at the very end some fruity and acidulous notes - it seems to me the characteristic of Pacari chocolates. It's a very present, well marked taste, which arrives slowly on the tongue and spreads quietly in the whole mouth.
This chocolate won gold at the International Chocolate Awards and I understand why. It is balanced, powerful and subtle, and everyone can appreciate it at its full value. A safe, solid chocolate, an ideal representative for Pacari.
