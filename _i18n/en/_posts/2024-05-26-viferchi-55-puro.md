Viferchi offers a very fruity chocolate with notes of peach, red fruit and mint. Unfortunately, at 55% it is very, perhaps too, sweet — giving the impression of a supermarket candy rather than a fine chocolate.

It's a pity, because knowing these flavors come only from cacao is quite extraordinary.
