Orange blossom water, cinnamon and nutmeg. These are the first touches that come with this impressive chocolate. Smooth and fruity, it slowly melts in the mouth, slowly introducing new flavors. The butter softness comes later, with a touch of caramel. 

A light, tasty, fine and complex chocolate, one of the best, a must try.
