It says on the package that the cocoa comes from Joya de los Sachas, in the Amazon. I deduce that it is Sacha cocoa. The chocolate has the same characteristics: it has a sweet and comfortable taste of caramel and butter. The texture is quite smooth, although if you try hard to criticize, you may find it a little floury.

This chocolate gives off the same impression as a good house wine from a restaurant, or a cake from a talented but amateur baker: it's not perfect, no, but it is comforting and warm. And in this, it highlights Sacha cocoa very well.
