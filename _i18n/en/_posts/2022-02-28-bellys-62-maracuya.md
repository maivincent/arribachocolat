**Warning: I know that this chocolate has been heavily denatured in terms of consistency, due to the whitening phenomenon. So in this article I try to overlook this, until I get another bar for a more complete review**.

This chocolate is made with "fino de altura" cocoa, that is to say, if I understood correctly, a particular species of CCN-51 that grows at high altitude. 

The taste is actually quite airy. Rather than the fruity side of the maracuya, it is the floral side that stands out, while the chocolate adds an unexpected taste of rosemary and tobacco. 
I'm surprised that this chocolate is 62%, and that it contains a lot of sugar, as it is particularly bitter. However, it is not the usual bitterness of cocoa: it is more like that of a grapefruit. Perhaps it comes rather from the maracuya?

An interesting chocolate, which goes off the beaten track.
