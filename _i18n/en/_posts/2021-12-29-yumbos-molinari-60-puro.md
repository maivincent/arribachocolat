For some reason, this chocolate, associated with Yumbos, is named after the co-founder and co-owner of the brand, Molinari. He probably wanted to make his signature chocolate.
Like the other Yumbos, it is a chocolate with a brittle texture. It breaks into several pieces under the tooth, and only then it melts slowly.
This chocolate has a particular taste, very fruity, a little acidulous, which takes a lot of space. One guesses behind the usual notes of butter, and, far away, of wood. There is no bitterness at all. It's quite light, a bit airy - if it were music, it would be mostly high-pitched, and would lack bass. The taste doesn't stay in the mouth for long.
In short, a good chocolate, which demonstrates by its flavor and texture the variety accessible with aroma fino cocoa. To be tried, as it deserves its place on the map.
