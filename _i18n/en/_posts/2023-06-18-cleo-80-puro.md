Sacha cocoa is always surprising. At 80%, it has no bitterness. On the contrary, it is, for lack of a better word, refreshing - like mint. The taste is rather woody, with hints of hazelnut, and a strong buttery feeling. 

This is an excellent chocolate, not in the finesse of its preparation, but in the purity of Sacha cocoa's originality.
