The white truffle is a highly aromatic fungus from Piedmont, Italy. Wikipedia compares its scent to camembert with garlic. What led Pacari to incorporate it into a chocolate bar?

No idea, but it's a success. The aroma is not too strong (often the case with truffle products); it merely colors the cocoa, which remains the main element. The result is a unique, rather sweet and very pleasant bar.
