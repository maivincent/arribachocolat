Now Arariwa speaks to me. Arariwa's 72% bars, with almonds and pistachios, are made from "fino de aroma" cacao. They are good, but fairly ordinary.

Here we have an arriba cacao, more refined, and you can enjoy all its depth with this 100% bar. Very little bitterness, this chocolate alternates notes of dried fruit, caramel, pine bark, floral perfume and cherry. These notes appear and fade in a unique, comforting melody that builds as you taste the squares and your palate adjusts to the different flavors.

As with any good-quality 100% bar, even without sugar it can be savored without drying your mouth. Each square brings new sensations, making it hard to stop.

To be honest, I finished it in one go...
