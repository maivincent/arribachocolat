Hierbaluisa, known as "samachik" in Kichwa, or lemon verbena in English, is an aromatic plant native to South America, similar to lemongrass. It is typically used for making herbal teas or desserts.

In this chocolate, the pronounced taste of hierbaluisa essence is the initial sensation, while the cocoa remains in the background, adding a foundation of sweetness that complements the lighter side of lemon verbena.

A very good chocolate bar that utilizes the roundness of Sacha cocoa to highlight the samachik.
