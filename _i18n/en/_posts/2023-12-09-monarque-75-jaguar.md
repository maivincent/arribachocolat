Monarque is a Montreal-based chocolatier—not Ecuadorian. It comes as a surprise during a visit to the fine chocolate shop "État de Choc": Ecuadorian cocoa... but different from the others.

Indeed, the "Jaguar" is the cousin of the cocoa we've already seen in pieces under the name Mocambo in a Mashpi chocolate bar. Here, the mocambo is directly integrated into the chocolate paste. Add a touch of vanilla, and you have a unique chocolate.

With notes of cashews, hazelnuts, and almonds, along with a hint of biscuit, it's a warm and rounded chocolate that will delight everyone.
