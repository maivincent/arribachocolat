_In addition to the traditional chocolate bars, Pacari offers small delicacies to be nibbled one by one: cocoa nibs covered with chocolate. Dusted with cinnamon, they are left to melt in the mouth until only the crunchy, slightly bitter, pure cocoa piece remains inside. Pacari offers three flavors: natural, banana, and ginger._

Do you like ginger? 
Those who answer yes to this question will enjoy this. The mixture with cinnamon and chocolate is rich in flavors that evolve as the candy melts on the tongue, with the smoothness of a spicy hot chocolate. Of course, you can't really taste the Pacari chocolate. But you can tell its subtlety and roundness by the ease with which the chocolate blends the cinnamon and ginger. I don't think that using another chocolate would have had the same result...
