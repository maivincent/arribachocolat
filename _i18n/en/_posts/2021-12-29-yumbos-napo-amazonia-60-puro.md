This chocolate is probably the best representative of Yumbos. 
As for the other chocolates of the brand, the texture can be surprising, as it is a little bit brittle. It is a very light and round chocolate, which is to be quickly enjoyed. As usual with Amazonian cocoa (I guess it's Sacha), we can notice a little bit of butter and mint, as well as a little touch of vanilla.

Despite its particular texture, it is quite a pleasant chocolate.
