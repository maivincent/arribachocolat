This bar with thick squares is not very sweet despite its relatively low 68% level. It's somewhat bitter with smoky notes, stout-beer hints and coconut. Toward the end, a touch of green mint appears, hidden behind a buttery taste.

While the flavor is original, it may lack some intensity to better distinguish its nuances.
