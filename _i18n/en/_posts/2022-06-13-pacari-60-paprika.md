Who ever thought of mixing paprika and chocolate?
The result is quite surprising. First of all, it is the smoky, rich paprika that takes center stage, quietly softened by a chocolate that balances and structures the whole.
Clearly, in this chocolate, the emphasis is put on the spice. It is not with this bar that we will appreciate the cocoa arriba. But Pacari dares, and dares well.
