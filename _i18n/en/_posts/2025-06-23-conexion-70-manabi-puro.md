As often, Conexion greets us with a chocolate whose intensity strikes from the first second and continues throughout the tasting. This is a very fruity chocolate on the berry side: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, currants. You are also transported to the warmth of the Manabí coast — you can almost sense the scent of hot, humid plantations, even from an air-conditioned apartment in Montreal.

Overall impression: an intense and pleasant chocolate with a color all its own. In the tradition of Conexion's high quality.
