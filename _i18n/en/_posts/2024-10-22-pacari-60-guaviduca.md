Guaviduca has a lovely name — but you'd be very good to know what it is. A search brings up scientific articles about an Amazonian essence, Latin name Piper carpunya (a pepper species), traditionally used by the Shuar people to treat inflammation, wounds and ulcers.

I didn't test medicinal effects in this bar. Flavor-wise, guaviduca brings a mix of mint and pepper with a base of slightly bitter green tea that blends subtly with Pacari's chocolate.

A unique, fine bar that plays in nuance and balance.
