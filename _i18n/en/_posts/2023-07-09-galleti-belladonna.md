Confidence: I'm not a big fan of figs.
Confidence 2: Except in this chocolate.

It's a smooth chocolate. Each ingredient is in its place, and the whole is as unique as it is pleasant. 
So it's not the fine cocoa that's in the spotlight. In fact, I don't see it written that it's arriba cocoa - simply, "fine aroma", and therefore of superior quality. 

Well, it's a top-quality bar, perhaps Galletti's best, to be tried and offered without hesitation.
