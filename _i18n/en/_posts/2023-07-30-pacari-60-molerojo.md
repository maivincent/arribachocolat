Look up mole rojo on the internet: you'll find that it's a traditional Mexican chili-based sauce (mole). 
Since the bar's package shows a red powdered spice, it seems to me that it must be a form of Latin American paprika.

Clearly, the taste is different from Pacari au Pimenton de la Vera (Spanish paprika): less smoky, less sweet, it's rather round and robust, with a tiny hint of spiciness that brightens things up.

A pleasant, well-balanced chocolate, original and rooted in the Pacari tradition of quality.
