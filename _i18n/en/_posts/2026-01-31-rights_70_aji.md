Rights is the brand whose mission (and marketing strategy) is to employ people with disabilities. Since my last experiences with this brand, the box design has evolved: from festive colors to a more refined image.

The chocolate itself hasn't changed. Woody and elegant, it is lightly sweetened by panela. The added chili (ají) is not very strong and mostly stays in the background, bringing a pleasant warming touch.
