It is a chocolate reminiscent of dried fruits: first almonds and hazelnuts, then apricots and raisins. Slightly sweet, it gains in subtlety if you let it melt gently in the mouth: the notes decline slowly but cover an interesting range. Once swallowed, there is nothing left.

An interesting and pleasant little bar, a brick to add to the edifice of Ecuadorian fine chocolates.
