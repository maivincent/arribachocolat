A strange combination of flavors, and yet, the blend is perfect. Juniper berry is often used to make gin - so that's the first element that comes to mind. After the initial surprise, however, it allows the chocolate to express itself, enhancing it and enabling its flavors to be discovered from a new perspective.

A very well-executed gamble by Pacari.
