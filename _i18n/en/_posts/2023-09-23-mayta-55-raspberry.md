The small pieces of dried raspberry added beneath the chocolate bring a rounded touch of acidity that blends perfectly with Mayta's smooth and comforting chocolate.

This chocolate may not be unique in the nuances of its cocoa. Instead, it gives the impression of biting into the heart of a chocolate-raspberry mousse crafted by a master pastry chef, savoring a rich brownie accompanied by a raspberry sorbet that melts languidly. This makes it a chocolate essential for any connoisseur.
