Turmeric is often associated with Indian spices, as that's the subcontinent from which it originates. But it also grows in South America, and if Mashpi has already tried cardamom, it's only natural that they should try chocolate with turmeric.

Turmeric's flavour generally stays in the background of the dish it accompanies, and that's the case here too. That's not to say it's not there: you can feel it, a quiet influence that adds its golden touch to the taste of this excellent Mashpi chocolate.

Note: I don't know what the cocoa percentage of this bar is, as it's a special edition with a generic box. I think it's quite dark, as it's a more astringent chocolate than usual, with a hint of bitterness.  

All in all, it's an original and interesting chocolate, but perhaps not the best in the Mashpi collection.
