During a trip to the Yucatan, I couldn't resist. The Yucatan is where the Maya used cacao as currency and sacred fruit. Mexico is where Europeans discovered and transformed cacao into the chocolate we know.

Fine chocolates are harder to find than in Ecuador, but Ki'Xocolatl focuses on it. The bar I tried won the AVPA Paris Gold in 2021 and claims to use Mexican cacao from Chiapas, Tabasco and Yucatan.

This chocolate has strong caramel and walnut notes with an unusual but pleasant hint of mushrooms. No milk is used, yet there's a certain sweetness that could mislead in a blind tasting.

Compared to Ecuadorian arriba or fino de aroma cacao, the fruity/floral side is absent here.

Still, a fine and pleasant chocolate worth trying if you're in Mérida.
