This is a chocolate that hits hard from the first second. Its well-defined character, quite full-bodied and a little bitter, makes you think at the first bite of coffee or wood. But after the first impression, if you give it time, the arriba chocolate takes over, with small touches of raspberry and cherry. The more you eat it, the less your taste buds are affected by the bitterness, and the more you can appreciate the other nuances. So this is an experience to try, especially for those who like their chocolate intense and striking, over several squares.
