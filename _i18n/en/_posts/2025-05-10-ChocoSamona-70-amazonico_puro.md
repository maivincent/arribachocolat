Of great gentleness, this chocolate slowly reveals its flavors. You need to let it melt slowly. Then one likes to imagine the dessert it sketches: chestnut cream, pear, and vanilla.

This bar was produced in the middle of the Amazon forest, in the Yasuni, a megadiverse area threatened by the oil reserves it hosts.

ChocoSamona’s 70% presents a chocolate with round, powerful flavors. The tasting opens on dark tropical fruit, then evolves towards notes of toasted nuts and a hint of earthiness reminiscent of the rainforest floor. The balance is well managed, offering both freshness and depth. The finish is persistent and very pleasant.
