I'll admit it — apart from second-hand smoke, I have never been in contact with tobacco, neither by smoking nor chewing.
So this is my first experience with the plant!

And it's quite striking. The chocolate starts gently, with a caramel roundness accentuated by vanilla. After five seconds, as you begin searching for the tobacco, it suddenly appears, strongly. A somewhat astringent, sharp taste, a kind of herbaceous pepper that quickly takes center stage, relegating the cacao to a supporting role.

I'm not sure this bar is the one that best showcases fine aromatic chocolate. I also don't think it's the most pleasant chocolate in the collection. But it's clearly a unique and memorable experience — and that's what we're here for, right?
