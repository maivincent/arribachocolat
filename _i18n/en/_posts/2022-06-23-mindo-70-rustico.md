Mindo chocolate, as you may have noticed, is among my favorites. Powerful and fine, its signature is recognizable at first bite.
In this "rustic" bar, the cocoa is stone ground, hand tempered, and the sugar crystals are whole.
It is especially in the texture that we notice the difference: much less smooth, this bar melts less pleasantly in the mouth. You have to wait for the sugar crystals to crunch under the tooth so that they soften the bitterness of the cocoa that coats them.
An interesting chocolate, obviously unique, and a welcome and well-tried variation for Mindo. But it clearly doesn't replace their best chocolates.
