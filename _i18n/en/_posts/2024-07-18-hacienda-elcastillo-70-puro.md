Hacienda El Castillo makes chocolate from plantation to bar. This trinitario cacao, named "Don Homero," is distinct from arriba cacao and similar to other trinitario bars I've tried.

Its flavor takes time to express: fruity notes with banana roundness, passionfruit acidity, and a baked bread richness. A herbaceous hint, like thyme, rounds things off after several seconds.

Texture is rather firm — it melts slowly, and the large, thick squares emphasize that. Still, it's enjoyable because you can take time to taste.
