This Wiñak chocolate comes from cacao harvested by Kichwa communities in the Sumaco reserve, inside the Napo Galeras national park.

Beginning with black tea notes, it gently evolves toward vanilla caramel and dried grape, while keeping a woody bitterness in the background accompanied by a surprising menthol freshness.
The flavor then lingers in the mouth, extending into a fresh-bread note.

It's a well-balanced 85% chocolate that plays on many registers, unfolding in several touches that appear during tasting.

A very good surprise!
