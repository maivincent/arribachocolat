Despite the "floral" label on the box, I wouldn't really classify this chocolate in that category. This chocolate leans more toward cereal flavors, like malt or quinoa, with a slightly fermented edge that evokes yogurt.
The texture is rather matte but quite crunchy.

A good chocolate, nothing more.
