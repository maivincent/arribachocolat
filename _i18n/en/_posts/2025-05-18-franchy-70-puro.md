This is an odd chocolate. At 70% you'd expect a dark bar—and nowhere is milk listed as a prominent feature. Yet milk appears in the ingredient list, and you can taste it.
It remains subtle, however, making the chocolate sit on the boundary between the two types. You feel power and bitterness, and a bit of fruitiness. But the "milk cloud," as the English say, is present: a comfortable, sweet, pleasant haze, at the cost of depth and precision.

It's neither milk chocolate nor true dark chocolate. It's a blend of both that doesn't simply build on the best of both worlds. It feels a bit lost along the way.
