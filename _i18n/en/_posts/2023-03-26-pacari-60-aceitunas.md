A former flatmate of mine used to eat nutella with feta cheese. In the face of my initial disgust, he offered me a taste - and I was surprised to have to admit that it wasn't such a bad idea (though I haven't had it since).

Pacari goes in the same direction: green olives and chocolate, it's a bit unusual. But what if it's surprisingly good?

Well, it's not. It tastes exactly like you think it tastes. Green olives in dark chocolate. It's certainly unique, but rather unpleasant...

But Pacari's expertise is evident: I'm sure it's one of the best green olive chocolates in the world!
