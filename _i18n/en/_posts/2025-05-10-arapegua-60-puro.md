Arapegua's 60% is a gentle and balanced chocolate. It offers soft notes of cocoa powder, milk caramel, and light dried fruit. The texture is creamy and the finish leaves a pleasant sweetness without being cloying. An enjoyable bar for those who appreciate subtlety over force.

Little surprise! I bought this chocolate in Quito... yet it is Argentinian, from the Misiones province bordering Paraguay.
It appears to be a limited edition, as the Arapegua cooperative—better known for mate production—no longer offers it in their shop.

It's a pleasant chocolate, fairly sweet at 60%. At first it seems ordinary, but with attention one finds touches of dried fruits—raisins, apricots—and hints of Alicante nougat.
