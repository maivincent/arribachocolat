It's a chocolate that takes a bit of time to declare itself. But when the flavors spread in the mouth, they are rich, powerful, and linger long after tasting.

The taste evolves. From hazelnut, it quickly shifts towards a slightly bitter caramel, ending with a strangely fresh and ethereal note.

A delicate and remarkable chocolate.
