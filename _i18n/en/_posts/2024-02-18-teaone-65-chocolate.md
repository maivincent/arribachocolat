I finally managed to find a new Teaone bar and try it.

Re-reading my January 2022 notes, I find some common points, but this is a more positive experience. Here we have a low-sugar but warming chocolate that goes for smokiness, hazelnut and coffee.

The texture is again imperfect, a bit grainy and pasty; it lacks the smoothness and melt one would expect from a good chocolate. This may again be an issue related to transport or storage — it remains problematic.

In short, a correct chocolate, but clearly not the best.
