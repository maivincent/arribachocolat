In Otavalo, north of Quito, the Muyus café sells coffee and chocolate. They produce their own bars, though the small print reveals the bar was made by Huma — a collaboration.

This chocolate is a refined candy: small passion fruit pieces strongly punctuate the experience, with the always-winning cocoa-passion combination. It's a bright, comforting chocolate. Of course, it's harder to assess the cacao's finesse itself beyond its round, warm character.

A lovely experience, a treat that stands out.
