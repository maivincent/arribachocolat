Fruity and floral, as the purple box of this Conexion chocolate states. It's true: a light mix of bitterness and acidity recalls grapefruit, rounded by the sweetness of red grapes and powerful fermentation-derived notes.

All of this sits in a crunchy yet smooth texture — a success that confirms Conexion's steady quality.
