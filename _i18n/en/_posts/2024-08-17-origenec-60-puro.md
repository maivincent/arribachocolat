Origenec from Latacunga in the Cotopaxi highlands offers a very fine bar. The chocolate is gentle, with notes of dried apricot and cardamom that extend toward walnut.

I expected a stronger character from a high-altitude cocoa, similar to Belly's chocolate. This one rather ensures it is pleasant to all.
