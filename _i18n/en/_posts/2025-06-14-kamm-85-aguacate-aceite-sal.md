Kamm's 85% with avocado oil and a hint of salt plays with texture and flavor in an unusual way. The base chocolate is powerful and bitter, but the avocado oil brings a silky, fatty mouthfeel that smooths the edges and the salt highlights subtle roasted and nutty notes. An experimental but well-constructed bar.

Kamm seeks originality. I hadn't enjoyed some other creations much, but this one is frankly interesting.
Chocolate, salt, avocado and olive oil — what a strange combination. Don't expect a treat: it's more of an experience. The low-sugar chocolate accompanies the astringency of the olive oil. The avocado is freeze-dried: granular and sandy, it brings unexpected texture and a rounded taste. The salt is not in crystals: it accompanies everything, like on a salad you'd enjoy on a terrace on a summer afternoon.

A chocolate that invites you out of the ordinary, because sometimes discovery succeeds.
