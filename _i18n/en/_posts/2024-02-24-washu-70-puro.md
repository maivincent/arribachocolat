Made with arriba nacional cacao, this fruity and creamy chocolate recalls orange blossom water, cinnamon and apple. It's rather light; give it time to express itself, but it's clearly worth it.

Notably, this very good chocolate is produced by Washu, an organization that aims through sustainable cacao farming to preserve the primary forest of the Tesoro Escondido reserve in the Chocó region of Ecuador — the native habitat of several critically endangered species such as the brown-headed spider monkey, whose indigenous (Chachi) name gives the project its title.
