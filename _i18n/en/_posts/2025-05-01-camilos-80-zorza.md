Camilo's is a bean-to-bar chocolaterie from Rosemère. I met them at an artisan market. The cocoa comes from the Reserva Zorzal in the Dominican Republic.

Intense and deep, it reminds me of a glass of red wine with its tannins, fruity touches of plums and cherries, and a slightly tart accent. It finishes with an appropriate bitterness that lingers in the mouth.

An interesting chocolate with merits that recall the Vietnamese Alluvia.
