Belly's chocolate is surprising. I'm not sure how the tempering (the operation that makes chocolate crisp and homogeneous) is performed, but the texture does not seem optimal: a bit soft and crumbly, with multiple crystals like maple butter.
However, the taste is intense and unique: a mix of mandarin, slightly acidic and bitter, and an airy violet aroma; it then tends toward sweet butter, like leftover batter when you were a child invited to lick the bowls after baking.

This is a fine altitude cacao, meaning it's grown above one kilometer altitude — a trait of certain specific cacao subtypes of CCN51. This chocolate, named "Rio Alambi", is cataloged here: https://cocoaflavormap.cacaomovil.com/site/place/rio-alambi
