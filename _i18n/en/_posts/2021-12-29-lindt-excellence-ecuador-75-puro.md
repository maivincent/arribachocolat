_The world's best-known brand of fine chocolates couldn't miss the arriba cocoa..._

This is first and foremost a Lindt chocolate - with its signature silky, shiny texture and recognizable taste. It starts with a few intense, rather quick notes, then the tone quickly becomes subtle, a bit toasted and bitter. Some nuances can be detected, if you let it melt on the tongue: a little bit of caramel and vanilla.

With this chocolate, Lindt does not manage to honor the quality of arriba cacao. My hypotheses are the following: first, a shyness in marketing pushes the brand to keep it as Lindt chocolate - recognizable in taste, and not too strong. Secondly, difficulties in maintaining quality standards, both for the cocoa raw material and for the confection, as it is a chocolate that is probably distributed worldwide. This may explain the additives like soy lecithin and natural flavors, as well as the choice of a more bitter chocolate, probably more roasted, which can hide irregularities and imperfections.
