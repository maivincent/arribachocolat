Calamondin? In Ecuador? With chocolate? That's an original and bold choice. Calamondin is a small citrus fruit native to the Philippines, similar to mandarin and kumquat.

Its fragrant zest blends perfectly with Mashpi's fruity and rich chocolate, culminating in a subtle drop of bitterness. It's a rare combination of finesse and intensity.

As often is the case, Mashpi explores unlikely blends that, when tasted, seem surprisingly obvious.
