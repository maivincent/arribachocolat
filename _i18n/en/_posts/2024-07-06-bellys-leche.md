Belly's chocolate is made from high-altitude cacao, which gives a particular taste and texture present across their bars.
Here, milk softens Belly's edges, making it creamy and sweet. You can still recognize signature high-altitude flavors — rosemary and tobacco — transformed by milk into fresh notes of mint and watermelon.

It's a good milk chocolate that allows high-altitude cacao to express itself in a new angle. A pleasant experience!
