Guayusa is a plant from the holly family, native to the Amazon rainforest, and it contains caffeine. It is used as an herbal tea, similar to tea, for its stimulating effects. My taste buds struggle to recognize its flavor. In this chocolate - a special edition from Mashpi - an herbal aspect comes through, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste.

It's an interesting experience to discover a new plant (and perhaps, wake up a bit?), but it's not the blend that best showcases Mashpi's chocolate.
