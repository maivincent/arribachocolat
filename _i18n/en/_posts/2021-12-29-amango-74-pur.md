_It's always good to be reminded of the uniqueness of arriba cocoa from time to time.
This chocolate is made by [Amango](https://www.amangocacao.com/), an artisanal chocolate factory in Montreal. We were able to visit it and talk to the owner, who is very friendly. The cocoa comes directly from Africa (Ivory Coast and Tanzania) and the chocolate factory follows the "bean to bar" model._

This chocolate starts on an acid note and ends with a little bitterness. Quite earthy, it mostly brings out aromas of roasted coffee or smoked wood. There are also some touches of rosemary. The consistency is smooth and melting. 
The difference with the cacao arriba is obvious: the fruity and floral side is absolutely absent. It remains a fine chocolate, but it seems to me less complex and varied.
