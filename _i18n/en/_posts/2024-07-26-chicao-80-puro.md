What a joy to find a new Chicao bar. The 70% had already made a great impression on me.
Here we have another excellent chocolate. Without any bitterness, it blends the perfumed notes of orange blossom, the roundness of banana, and the tang of mango.

An extraordinary chocolate, and incredibly fresh.
