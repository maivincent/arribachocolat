What a delight! The Mashpi 65% chocolate is a masterpiece - see the related article [here](). A layer of sweet and acidulous jam, made from cocoa pulp, is added in a small compartment on top of the bar: this is the white paste that surrounds the cocoa beans in the pod (it is also called mucilage). Without covering the deep taste of Mashpi chocolate, it brings freshness, richness and originality. 
One of the best Ecuadorian chocolates, without hesitation.
