This chocolate is part of Minka's Single Origin collection, with cocoa from different farms in Ecuador. El Refugio is located in the province of Esmeraldas, on the west coast, near the Colombian border. It is a rather light and airy chocolate, whose notes are mostly floral and herbal: jasmine tea, cumin, and a little hazelnut or almond at the end. Pleasant and interesting, it is however not very intense. It remains nevertheless a long time in mouth, leaving a sensation of freshness which reminds strangely that of a piece of ginger marinated between two sushis.
