When you taste several chocolates from the same brand, you begin to recognize a certain signature—flavors that echo across different cocoa origins.

This Guayas chocolate highlights several characteristic elements of ChocoCumi's single-origin bars. It has roundness and richness, evoking a creamy brownie. These chocolates don't stand out for radical originality but for their skillful balance of fineness and comfort.

More specifically, this bar shows a little more bitterness than the previous ones, with notes of bark, raspberries and caramel.
