Unique bar of the brand, it comes in 100g format, with large squares of a good thickness. This gives time to let the chocolate melt and enjoy all the nuances.
It is a chocolate with a rather classic flavor, close to walnut, hazelnut and caramel. Without bitterness or acidity, it is round in the mouth. Once melted, it leaves a small aftertaste of red fruits.
A good quality chocolate, but perhaps not as fine as others in this list.
