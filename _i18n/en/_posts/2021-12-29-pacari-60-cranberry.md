(Note: the bar I'm trying is too old and the chocolate has spoiled over time. I'll try to go over it and imagine a fresh bar - but the evaluation obviously suffers, both in texture and taste).

The taste of the cranberry is usually pronounced: acid, bitter and sweet. Here, on the contrary, it is subtle. Very subtle. You could easily overlook it and mistake it for regular chocolate... But when you really look for it, you realize that it's actually there. It blends in so well with the chocolate that you can only detect it in the background, but it gives it a definite color, without being noticed. Kind of like the bass score of a song.
Is it an extraordinary chocolate? No. But it is a sure value: the quality of Pacari chocolate is there, and the cranberry complements it without denaturing it.
