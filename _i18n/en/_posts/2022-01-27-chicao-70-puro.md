The chicao is a small bird, called [yellow-backed oriole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-backed_oriole) in English, from the cloud forests of South America. There are similarities with the chocolate bar of the same name: light, fruity, joyful. 
In more detail, the flavor begins with a passion fruit and mango note, which remains on the palate for a long time. The taste then evolves towards a rather light fudge, ending quickly. There is almost nothing left once the chocolate is swallowed.
The texture is like the heart of a chocolate fondant cake: a little floury at the beginning, it becomes smoother when the chocolate warms up on the tongue.

A very good surprise for a small production, this chocolate deserves its place in the fine chocolates of Ecuador.
