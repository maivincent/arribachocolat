Here is a surprising dark chocolate whose notes clearly differ from the Ecuadorian chocolates I've tried so far.

We are in an herbaceous world here, with mushroom and tobacco notes, and hints of toasted baguette... everything starts airy and precise, then slowly gains space and roundness, with a flavor that lingers long in the mouth.

It's a rather pleasant chocolate, but above all one that stands out for new tonalities.
