It is now clear that the Mindo chocolate paste is one of my favorites. In this chocolate, it combines with the flavor of ginger. It's mostly small candied pieces, which crisp up slightly under the tooth. With a bright and detailed flavor, this is a bar that gets eaten too quickly, perhaps because it has a little less depth than the previous ones.
