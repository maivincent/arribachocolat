This chocolate from Mindo tries to find a balance between the taste of chili, which modifies the flavor of the chocolate, and its spiciness. We feel a hesitation: to avoid that it stings too much, we don't have much flavor.
The result: a chocolate that looks a lot like (the excellent!) Mindo 77% chocolate, with a little spiciness at the end.

Because it is Mindo chocolate, it is very good. But it's a slight disappointment in terms of originality.
