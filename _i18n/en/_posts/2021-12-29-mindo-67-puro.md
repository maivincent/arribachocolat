Like its 77% cousin, this chocolate is incredibly fine. While remaining quite similar, it is less woody, goes for more butter and mint tones, and leaves an almost refreshing taste in the mouth. The result is a chocolate that is a little less powerful, that tastes a little less long, but that is perhaps the best entry point for amateurs of gentler chocolates.

Another success for Mindo Chocolate, an extraordinary chocolate.
