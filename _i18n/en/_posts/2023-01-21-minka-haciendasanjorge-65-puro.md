A floral chocolate. It opens with a bouquet of jasmine, rose and orange blossom, followed by cherries and hazelnuts, enveloping a slightly bitter woody heart. 
It's a great chocolate, provoking a firework display of flavors.

If it lacked a little something, it would be warmth. I have the strange feeling that the squares are somewhat grumpy, and the funny urge to remind them that they could make the effort to be happy to be savored.

It's still an excellent chocolate, to be considered among the best.
