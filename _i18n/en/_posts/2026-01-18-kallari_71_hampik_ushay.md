Kallari's cacao is, as always, very gentle. Here it is accompanied by candied ginger pieces and ginger essence present in the chocolate itself. The result is a calm, composed chocolate that doesn't aim to overwhelm with intense or singular flavors. It is rather a small, fragrant, and pleasant sweetness.
