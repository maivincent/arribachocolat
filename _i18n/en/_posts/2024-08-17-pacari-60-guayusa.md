Guayusa is an aromatic, stimulating herb mainly cultivated in Ecuador. It was therefore expected that Pacari would incorporate it into a chocolate bar.

As usual with Pacari, it's well controlled. Guayusa takes an important but balanced place, accompanied delicately by the cocoa.

A solid bar that ranks among the brand's excellent chocolates.
