It is usually a challenge for international chocolatiers to capture all the nuances of Ecuadorian cocoa. 
This is the case here as well: the roasting process described at level 3/5 gives the chocolate a bitter taste that covers the floral and fruity side of the fino d'aroma.
Fortunately, all is not lost, as this chocolate is carefully crafted. So there are strong woody notes, a caramel background and a little citrus edge.

An intense and interesting chocolate, but whose potential is not completely reached.

Note: Bravo to Avanaa for putting forward the chocolate of the Kallari community!
