Cocoa pulp, also called mucilage, surrounds the beans inside the pod. It's a sweet and tart food.

Here Pacari incorporates it into their 60% chocolate as small dried pieces. Their sugary acidity contrasts with the crunchy, bitter cocoa nibs, giving the bar a richness of textures and flavors, all wrapped in classic Pacari chocolate.

This is a bar that elegantly takes advantage of everything the cocoa pod can offer.
