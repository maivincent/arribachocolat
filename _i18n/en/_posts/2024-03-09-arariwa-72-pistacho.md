Pistachio is added to this chocolate in the form of pieces under the bar — a relatively classic technique to add an element without integrating it into the chocolate mass. In this case, pistachio and chocolate flavors don't really blend; the result is rather particular and heterogeneous, where the tongue sometimes tastes pistachio and sometimes chocolate in alternation.
I'm not sure this bar is the one that best highlights Arariwa chocolate — which I previously enjoyed pure. It remains an interesting and pleasant experience.
