I wasn't sure what to expect with Arawi, which can be found everywhere, but which I had never heard of. I was happily surprised: it's a light chocolate, whose cinnamon-like taste is balanced by the slightly malty bitterness of the cocoa beans. The consistency of the bar follows a certain dynamic: it starts rather smooth, but very quickly the cocoa nibs give it a sandy side, until the chocolate melts and only the crunch remains.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is the finest chocolate from Ecuador. But I'm eager to try the other bars in their collection!
