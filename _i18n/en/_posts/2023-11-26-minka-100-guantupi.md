I had five colleagues at the office taste this 100% dark chocolate. I received only positive comments. There are two possibilities: 1) Faced with my enthusiasm, my colleagues felt obliged to pretend a pleasant surprise, or 2) it's a 100% dark chocolate that is accessible and can be enjoyed as such.

I'm betting on a bit of both (yes, I'm sometimes a bit too enthusiastic), but the fact is that this chocolate from Minka is rich in the flavors and nuances of Arriba cocoa, while not being bitter and with a very tolerable astringency. On the box, it says: aromas of flowers, caramel, wood, honey, raisins, spices. For me, the wood, spices (pepper), and flowers are indeed present. But without sugar, it's tough to pick up on the honey, caramel, or raisins.

It remains a very good 100% chocolate, perhaps the best for those trying it for the first time.
