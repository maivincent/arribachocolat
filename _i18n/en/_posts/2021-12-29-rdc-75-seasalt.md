Salt is known to have several effects.

1) It's hard enough to control yourself when you have an open bar of chocolate on hand. That's the effect of sugar. But the situation is the same with salt - think bag of chips, or bowl of pistachios. Here, it's a combined effect, making this chocolate more addictive than ever.

2) Salt is a flavor enhancer. Republica del Cacao's chocolate is already quite tasty, so it only becomes more powerful.

3) The salt also changes the flavor of the food, and in this case, it is large crystals of fine sea salt. This allows us to discover other nuances of the chocolate base, which gains even more finesse.

Republica del Cacao uses in this bar the aspects of salt with finesse and skill, for an addictive, tasty and fine chocolate. A very good chocolate!
