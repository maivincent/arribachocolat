It's not chocolate! But it is a special product: it is a cocoa salami. I believe it is an Italian recipe... in any case, it is made from Ecuadorian chocolate.

Dense like chocolate, the salami is much more crumbly. The nutty bits (macadam, almond, and sunflower seeds) and the little bits of cranberry add textural variety. It's also much more nutritious! 
The taste is nice: not very sweet, yet not bitter or sour. It is rather the rich side of cocoa that stands out, behind the other foods. With a bit of attention, one can identify some spicy touches, a little taste of cardamom, which spice up the whole.

An interesting experience because it is new, and pleasant, without being extraordinary.

### Evaluation

It would not be very fair to rate it on the same scale as chocolate, so the rating will only be an indicator of my appreciation.

**Final evaluation**: 19.5/25
