Orange blossom water, speculoos and cinnamon, with a little touch of woody butter at the end. A dense chocolate, which melts slowly in the mouth, with a texture that lacks a little smoothness.

It's a good surprise: finally, an international chocolate maker (Belgian, in this case) who doesn't produce a bitter chocolate from arriba cocoa! It is a very good quality bar, which draws from the nuances of cocoa to define its own signature.

Note: despite the name Guayas of the bar, the plantations would be, according to the packaging, located in the northwest of Ecuador... Which would be Esmeraldas or Manabi?
