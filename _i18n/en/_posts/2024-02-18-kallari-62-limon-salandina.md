Soft, rich yet light.
The lemon flavor is pronounced here; as is often the case with Kallari chocolates, the added flavor takes the lead while the chocolate remains in the background.
We still get to enjoy Kallari's fresh chocolate, which blends pleasantly. The salt likely adds a subtle touch but is very discreet.

It's a good chocolate, though it could be hard to distinguish from a fine Belgian-style confection.
