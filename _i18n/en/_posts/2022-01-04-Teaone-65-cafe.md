I only bought one bar of Teaone. I don't particularly like coffee, so I chose the "puro" bar on purpose... but it seems that there was a small mistake. The package itself was not sealed: it is also possible that the chocolate went bad in the five days (including the plane trip) between the purchase in a store and the consumption.

This bar has a slightly doughy consistency: this immediately reduces its delicacy. The taste is there, even if it is not very strong. The coffee takes a lot of space, with a good bitterness, which is not to my liking, but this is personal. With some effort, we taste a little bit the nutty notes of cocoa. It is still difficult to appreciate the finesse.

Was the chocolate in good condition? Was it the bad surprise of the coffee that gave me such a bad impression? Did the famous virus rob me of my taste buds (just for this bar)? Or does Teaone still have some work to do in their recipe to improve consistency, taste, and packaging control in their production? In any case, this is not the tablet I was expecting. 

(Besides, it is quite expensive: 4$ for 40g of chocolate!)
