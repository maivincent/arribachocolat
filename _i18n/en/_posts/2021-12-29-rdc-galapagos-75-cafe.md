One of the most bitter of the Republica del Cacao collection. As someone who is not a coffee fan, I really like how the chocolate taste surrounds the coffee bits.
Despite the beautiful turtle on the cover, this is not my favorite. It's all about taste! I still highly recommend it to coffee lovers - you can still feel the finesse and uniqueness of this chocolate bar!
