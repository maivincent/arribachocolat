_It's always good to be reminded of the uniqueness of arriba cocoa from time to time.
This chocolate is made by [Amango](https://www.amangocacao.com/), an artisanal chocolate factory in Montreal. We were able to visit it and talk to the owner, who is very friendly. The cocoa comes directly from Africa (Ivory Coast and Tanzania) and the chocolate factory follows the "bean to bar" model._

It is an aggressively acidic chocolate, a little bitter, which hides a subtle background of bergamot and caramel. The consistency is well done, the chocolate melts delicately on the tongue. 
An efficient chocolate, but without particular elegance.
