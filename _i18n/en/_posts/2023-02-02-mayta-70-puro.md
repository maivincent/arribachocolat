This little bar is exactly the same shape as the Minka ones. The taste also has a similar touch: there are surely links between the two and similarities in the chocolate-making technique.

But the taste is deeper, less floral. This is one of those chocolates that would make an extraordinary brownie. Throughout the tasting, there are hints of smokiness, a touch of hazelnut roundness, and a hint of bitter citrus.

It's an excellent chocolate in every category, but perhaps a little reluctant to stand out.
