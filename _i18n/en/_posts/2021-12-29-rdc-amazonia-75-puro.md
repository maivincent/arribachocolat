This chocolate is one of my favorites. It has a little buttery taste and a cozy, warm feeling. It must be the color of the Amazon cocoa: it's Sacha cocoa, not arriba. I feel surprising notes of fresh mint at the end of the tasting. Let it melt on your tongue, and give yourself the time to enjoy all the phases and nuances it can bring!
