  <p>I’m a little disappointed, because the chocolate bar I received is in bad condition. You can tell right away: the surface is whitish, which means that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bloom">the cocoa butter or sugar has separated from the solids</a>, and the texture is severely altered. I bought it at the end of December and it’s January. I’m usually very careful about storing the bars - and the other ones do not have any problem. Without being sure, I assume that this is the condition in which Kallari sent it to me. In short, this, combined with the difficulty to order the chocolate in Quito with Kallari (delays and wrong products), gives a bad impression of their customer service.
Anyway, the goal is to evaluate the quality of their chocolate. It’s a bit tricky in this case, but I’ll make an effort and focus on the taste, which shouldn’t be changed, rather than the texture.</p>

<p>This is a light, fruity chocolate with hints of naranjilla and passion fruit. It also has a bit of bitterness, especially towards the end, when the acidic start softens.
This is definitely a great, fine, and unique chocolate, yet it lacks a bit of smoothness and comfort. It’s hard to say whether, with a bar in good condition and a less brittle texture, this aspect would be improved.</p>
