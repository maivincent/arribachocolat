&lt;p&gt;The maracuya is a subspecies of the passion fruit. It’s a very pretty name - my grandfather named his little sailboat after it. Pacari offers a warm and balanced chocolate here. The acidity of the maracuya mingles with the roundness of the cocoa for a major accord, which, after an intense strike, resonates for a long time in the palate, uncovering little by little new notes as the chocolate melts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best, if not the best, chocolates with added flavor from Pacari.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, the goal is to evaluate the quality of their chocolate. It’s a bit tricky in this case, but I’ll make an effort and focus on the taste, which shouldn’t be changed, rather than the texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a light, fruity chocolate with hints of naranjilla and passion fruit. It also has a bit of bitterness, especially towards the end, when the acidic start softens.
This is definitely a great, fine, and unique chocolate, yet it lacks a bit of smoothness and comfort. It’s hard to say whether, with a bar in good condition and a less brittle texture, this aspect would be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

The taste is nice: not very sweet, yet not bitter or sour. It is rather the rich side of cocoa that stands out, behind the other foods. With a bit of attention, one can identify some spicy touches, a little taste of cardamom, which spice up the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bar has a slightly doughy consistency: this immediately reduces its delicacy. The taste is there, even if it is not very strong.

It is still difficult to appreciate the finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was the chocolate in good condition? Was it the bad surprise of the coffee that gave me such a bad impression? Did the famous virus rob me of my taste buds (just for this bar)? Or does Teaone still have some work to do in their recipe to improve consistency, taste, and packaging control in their production? In any case, this is not the tablet I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
