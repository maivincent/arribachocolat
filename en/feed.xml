&lt;p&gt;Dense like chocolate, the salami is much more crumbly. The nutty bits (macadam, almond, and sunflower seeds) and the little bits of cranberry add textural variety. It’s also much more nutritious! 
The taste is nice: not very sweet, yet not bitter or sour. It is rather the rich side of cocoa that stands out, behind the other foods. With a bit of attention, one can identify some spicy touches, a little taste of cardamom, which spice up the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting experience because it is new, and pleasant, without being extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bar has a slightly doughy consistency: this immediately reduces its delicacy. The taste is there, even if it is not very strong. The coffee takes a lot of space, with a good bitterness, which is not to my liking, but this is personal. With some effort, we taste a little bit the nutty notes of cocoa. It is still difficult to appreciate the finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was the chocolate in good condition? Was it the bad surprise of the coffee that gave me such a bad impression? Did the famous virus rob me of my taste buds (just for this bar)? Or does Teaone still have some work to do in their recipe to improve consistency, taste, and packaging control in their production? In any case, this is not the tablet I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Besides, it is quite expensive: 4$ for 40g of chocolate!)&lt;/p&gt;

The difference with the cacao arriba is obvious: the fruity and floral side is absolutely absent. It remains a fine chocolate, but it seems to me less complex and varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is first and foremost a Lindt chocolate - with its signature silky, shiny texture and recognizable taste. It starts with a few intense, rather quick notes, then the tone quickly becomes subtle, a bit toasted and bitter. Some nuances can be detected, if you let it melt on the tongue: a little bit of caramel and vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this chocolate, Lindt does not manage to honor the quality of arriba cacao. My hypotheses are the following: first, a shyness in marketing pushes the brand to keep it as Lindt chocolate - recognizable in taste, and not too strong. Secondly, difficulties in maintaining quality standards, both for the cocoa raw material and for the confection, as it is a chocolate that is probably distributed worldwide. This may explain the additives like soy lecithin and natural flavors, as well as the choice of a more bitter chocolate, probably more roasted, which can hide irregularities and imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. In fact, this chocolate is proof of the opposite. Warning: it’s not sweet. But, if you’re looking to try and understand what makes arriba cacao and Ecuadorian chocolate so good, this is the perfect bar.
This chocolate has a bold taste of wood and nuts. A strong and fine aroma, hardly bitter, reminiscent of the smells of the humid and warm forests where this cocoa grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips: to be eaten in very small pieces, as the taste takes up a lot of space in the mouth, and the intensity of the chocolate dries up the saliva. It’s also worth having a glass of water nearby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A necessary experience for any serious chocolate enthusiast, who will appreciate this bar for what it represents: a perfect example of the finesse of arriba chocolate. You have to know what to expect though, as this is not a bar that will please everyone - avoid giving it as a gift as a first bar of Ecuadorian chocolate…!&lt;/p&gt;
