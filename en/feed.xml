So in this article I try to overlook this, until I get another bar for a more complete review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chocolate is made with “fino de altura” cocoa, that is to say, if I understood correctly, a particular species of CCN-51 that grows at high altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste is actually quite airy. Rather than the fruity side of the maracuya, it is the floral side that stands out, while the chocolate adds an unexpected taste of rosemary and tobacco. 
I’m surprised that this chocolate is 62%, and that it contains a lot of sugar, as it is particularly bitter. However, it is not the usual bitterness of cocoa: it is more like that of a grapefruit. Perhaps it comes rather from the maracuya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting chocolate, which goes off the beaten track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maracuya is a subspecies of the passion fruit. It’s a very pretty name - my grandfather named his little sailboat after it. Pacari offers a warm and balanced chocolate here. The acidity of the maracuya mingles with the roundness of the cocoa for a major accord, which, after an intense strike, resonates for a long time in the palate, uncovering little by little new notes as the chocolate melts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best, if not the best, chocolates with added flavor from Pacari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a light, fruity chocolate with hints of naranjilla and passion fruit. It also has a bit of bitterness, especially towards the end, when the acidic start softens.
This is definitely a great, fine, and unique chocolate, yet it lacks a bit of smoothness and comfort. It’s hard to say whether, with a bar in good condition and a less brittle texture, this aspect would be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
